**Infallible** is a group of adventurers, assembled primarily for the purposes of winning the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), although they ended up working together for other purposes as well, most notably the destruction of the [Blood Order](The Blood Order.md).

## History

TODO

## Ideology

While the initial idea behind Infallible was to donate the monetary reward toward fighting crime and to bring [the king](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Wyran I.md)'s attention to this issue, due to a constant turnover of members, the group has since diverged from that goal, instead becoming more of an alliance of individuals, each of whom seeks to expend their share of the prize for personal intentions. Similarly, while [Dionism](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Nameless Keeper.md) was the most popular religion among Infallible's members at one point, an influx of new recruits diluted the religious aspect as a distinguishable characteristic.

## Appearance

Members of Infallible share close to nothing in terms of appearance.

## Notable members

### Current

* [Baltrin Arion](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Baltrin.md), an orcish fighter, [Dionistic](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Nameless Keeper.md) zealot and former monster hunting mercenary. He traveled to [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) for the sole purpose of fighting in the tournament, and elected to join Reymar's team, due to him being a priest of Baltrin's faith. He went on to become the reason for the [Blood Order](The Blood Order.md)'s attacks on Infallible, leading to the group going on a mission to destroy it completely.
* [Curt](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Curt.md), an adept of the [Guild of Magi](Guild of Magi.md), trained in the Bladesong. He joined the group during their raid on the [Blood Order](The Blood Order.md)'s headquarters, and went on to become an official member after the raid's conclusion.
* [Darrius](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Darrius.md), a conservative vigilante fighter with a criminal past. Having turned a new leaf, seeking to combat crime in Dimok, he founded Infallible by threatening Reymar, Kahrl and Yalhra (he promised to spare Kahrl's life under the condition that they join him in his quest). He's declared that his share of the winner's purse, should they win the tournament, will be donated toward fighting crime. He strongly dislikes Nathaniel, whom he perceives as "not a real man".
* [Eve](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Eve.md), an intelligent steel battle construct. She was designed and assembled by Nathaniel, with the other members of Infallible providing most of the funding.
* [Leonard Laszlo](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Leonard Laszlo.md), a knight of [Hell](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Hell.md), the son of [Laszlo I](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Laszlo I.md) and a former member of the Blood Order. He, along with Todd, turned on his previous faction when [Samuel](#!Pages/Journal/Character/Samuel.md) recognized another former member in Baltrin, demanding that they murder him. Following the ensuing chaos, Laszlo joined Infallible, offering to call upon a powerful demon from the frozen wastelands of [Abyss](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Abyss.md) to aid them throughout the tournament. He would go on to become an official, registered member of the team. His goal is to amass wealth and demand answers from [King Wyran I](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Wyran I.md) regarding the demise of his father, as well as prove the fact, that his father had no knowledge of [Er Meleg](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Er Meleg.md)'s inhumane experiments.
* [Nathaniel](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Nathaniel.md), a half-elf engineer, student of the Guild of Magi and a former world-class fencer. He was initially suggested as a potential recruit by Darrius, who remembered him for nearly winning the [ISF World Championship](#!Iartar Swordsfighting Fedration.md) in 1295. Darrius' opinion of him changed radically, though, as he explained that he's given up swordsfighting and "hasn't been in shape" since his controversial loss. Despite the internal feud between the two, Darrius was eventually convinced to fund Nathaniel's project - the battle construct, Eve, that would fight for Infallible throughout the tournament in his stead. Nathaniel was also the originator and primary architect of the destruction of the Blood Order by Infallible.
* [Reymar](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Reymar.md), a cleric of [The Nameless Keeper](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Nameless Keeper.md) and a fresh student of the Guild of Magi. He was one of the group's founding members and went on to become arguably its most consistent face that keeps the diverse group together. Furthermore, he's one of the very few remaining members of Infallible, that intend to fulfill the promise made to Darrius and donate their share of the prize, should they win The Tournament, toward fighting crime.
* [Shiro](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Shiro.md), a Vilosa of the [Void](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Void.md), she joined Infallible purely due to them being the first available candidate she encountered. There is tension between her and Leonard Laszlo, stemming from the aeons old conflict between Hell and the Void. Her primary goal is to ask for an audience with [Lady Ivette Claville](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Ivette Claville.md), whose family banners she recognized as identical to those worn by soldiers that had burnt her home village.
* [Todd](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Todd.md), a marine with a fondness for alcohol and a former Blood Order member, who turned on the organization alongside his friend, Leonard Laszlo.

### Unconfirmed

* [No-one](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/No-one.md), a Dionistic flagellant, Reymar's disciple in faith. He's assisted the faction indirectly through following Reymar's orders, although it's likely that he does not consider himself a member. Moreover, he's never been officially registered as one for the purposes of the Tournament, even though he's been considered at one point when discussing strategy.
* [Ny'lha](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Ny'lha.md), a Na'khel (half-night, half-dark elf) Incantessa, specialized in water magic and assassination. She's declared her willingness to follow Reymar, although she still seems rather distanced from the rest of the group. Moreover, she's never been officially registered as a member for the purposes of the Tournament.

### Deceased

* [Aithem](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Aithem.md), an exiled angel bard, fascinated with the beauty of music. He was found dead on the 16th of June, 1300, in the sewers of [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md). His corpse was faceless.

### Former

* [Kahrl](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Kahrl.md), an orcish monk that finds satisfaction in killing others. He was one of the founding members, forced by Darrius to join his cause. He'd later leave the group with no explaination. Infallible encountered him in the the Blood Order's headquarters and killed him.
* [Yalhra](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Yalhra.md), the fire leed'he (half-elemental) Prophetusa and one of the founding members of the group. Despite Reymar's efforts to keep [the governor](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Alfred Kerraman.md) from arresting her, even resorting to questionable means, she ended up blowing the whistle on him when being questioned. Soon thereafter, she defected to [Defiant](Defiant.md), failing to explain her actions.
