**Defiant**, formerly known as **Change and Freedom**, is a chaotic neutral informal youth movement based in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md). Their numbers aren't significant, as they occupy merely a few abandoned buildings in the northern part of the city, which was deemed the Defiance District after the faction's name. Their members stand out in a crowd, though, mainly through their alternative, rebellious look, and every member also wearing a patch with the faction's symbol. Their main "headquarters" is the Defiant Inn, where they enjoy alternative music and the [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md) drink.

## History

The slow formation of the faction is said to have begun in 1299, driven by the teachings of [The Masked Man](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/The Masked Man.md). It began to take a more defined shape and form in 1300, when Terry introduced the brand new [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md) drink and [Amanda](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Amanda.md) opened her shop with clothing that has become synonymous with the faction. It also wasn't until June 1300 when she introduced the *"Defiant"* name.

Defiant went on to unofficially claim control over the Desolace District in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), renaming it *"Defiance"*.

[Infallible](Infallible.md) have first encountered Defiant by following [Brittany](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Brittany.md) and [Rosemary](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Rosemary.md) to the Defiance District. Since then, they have visited the Defiant Inn a few times, mostly in order to research the [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md) drink and listen to [Abigail](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Abigail.md)'s performances.

During one of his earliest visits to the Inn, [Reymar](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Reymar.md) healed a [fanatical atheist](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/No-one.md)'s severed finger (although doing so with fire, rather than a harmless spell), despite him showing no respect to Reymar's religion. A few times, Reymar happened to encounter The Masked Man, even witnessing him almost being murdered by [the mysterious shooter](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/The Murderer.md). He was then tasked by The Masked Man with finding out the murderer's identity, vaguely justifying it with the murderer being a common enemy of both himself and Infallible.

On the occasion of the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), a team representing Defiant has emerged, composed of [Amanda](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Amanda.md), [Brittany](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Brittany.md), [Abigail](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Abigail.md), [Yalhra](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Yalhra.md) and [Matilde](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Matilde.md), commonly known as **The Defiant's Five**. Yalhra had quietly defected from Infallible in the process, most likely due to spending more time with members of Defiant and her sudden, mysterious disagreement with Reymar. Meanwhile, it's unclear if Matilde has joined the Defiant faction proper, or whether she's just a temporary acquitance fighting under their banner for the duration of the tournament.

## Ideology

The movement is based mostly around absolute freedom, to an anarchistic degree. It's mostly composed from agitated, rebellious youth, who stand in opposition to the feudal, theocratic system of the [Kingdom of Northland](#!The Kingdom of Northland.md), based on traditional values. Members quite often cease to follow, or even outright disbelief, any form of religion, which they deem to be yet another means of controlling the masses.

Defiant also preach equality regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, origin or looks. The Defiant's Five has made it a point to prove that an all-female team can win the most prestigeous combat tournament in the world.

Members of Defiant often commit minor acts of vandalism, mostly painting graffiti using difficult-to-remove paint on religious or public objects.

## Appearance

Defiant's members share an extravagant, alternative, looks-over-comfort style, which has become synonymous with the faction. The pioneer of that style is [Amanda](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Amanda.md), who owns an apparel shop in the Defiance District.

Every member of the faction also wears a patch with the faction's symbols

## Notable members

### Current

* [Abigail](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Abigail.md), the green-haired bard often performing at Defiant Inn, seemingly took over the building after Terry's death.
* [Amanda](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Amanda.md), the black-haired [ISF](Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md) fencer and leader of the Defiant's Five and believed by many to be the face of Defiant.
* [Brittany](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Brittany.md), the blonde fire mage (possibly a Prophetusa) who looks up to Amanda as her mentor. Is Rosemary's girlfriend.
* [Chloe](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Chloe.md), the white-haired checkout girl at Amanda's shop. Is good friends with Yalhra.
* [The Masked Man](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/The Masked Man.md), said to be the actual leader and founder due to the other members following his teachings (although Brittany seemingly ignored his speech). He actually is the sole member of the faction that has never worn the faction's symbol or dressed even remotely similar to the other members.
* [Rosemary](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Rosemary.md), Brittany's dark-haired girlfriend, she joined the faction along with Brittany, having ran away from her village of Wolfville years prior to that, after a local priest, Father Romuald, had illegally attempted an exorcism on her.
* [Yalhra](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Yalhra.md), the fire leed'he (half-elemental) Prophetusa, formerly a member of [Infallible](Infallible.md). Is good friends with Chloe and stays at Amanda's shop.

### Unconfirmed

* [Matilde](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Matilde.md), a young Incantator specialized in the school of Transmutation, studying at the [Dimokian University of Magi](Dimokian University of Magi.md). She joined Defiant's Five, but it's unclear if she's a proper member, or just a temporary acquitance fighting under the Defiant banner for the duration of [the tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament).
* [Nyx](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Nyx.md), the teenage shadow Prophetus, currently in jail for having murdered his family and a patrol of city guards. He has never mentioned the faction, be it directly or indirectly, although a Defiant patch was found among his personal possessions.

### Deceased

* Terry, the innkeeper of Defiant Inn, inadvertently shot by [the mysterious murderer](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/The Murderer.md) with a bullet meant for The Masked Man.
