The **Iartar Swordsfighting Federation** (**ISF**) is a western fencing promotion, considered to be the most prominent fencing federation in the world. It sanctions the **ISF World Championship**, which is a title, represented with an ornate championship belt, contested in an annual tournament, sometimes run concurrently with [The Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md).

## Rules

The exact rules have never been detailed, although some of them are known:

* All matches are **1vs1**.
* Competitors are only allowed to use a **single sword** and a **parrying dagger**.
* A **technical victory** takes place when one of the competitors is directly in position to deliver a lethal blow. For example, having the point of the blade directly against the opponent's throat is enough to score a technical victory.
* The match can be stopped and awarded to one of the competitors at any point at the referee's discretion, resulting in **referee stoppage**. This takes place when the referee decides a competitor is unable to continue, for example due to them ceasing to defend themselves, or being fatally wounded and requiring instant medical assistance.
* Matches usually have a **time limit**. After it expires, the **referees decide** who won the contest.
* A **fatal victory** takes place when a competitor kills their opponent outright.
* The match can also end through **forfeit** when one of the competitors gives up.

### World Championship tournament

The ISF World Championship is contested in a single-elimination tournament, held over the course of a few days.

## Notable members

### Current

* [Amanda](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Amanda.md), one of the few female competitors, currently holds a record of 1-0-0, having scored her sole victory over Maximilien Pasteur within 6 seconds (technical).
* [Baron Sylvester le Vaque](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Sylvester le Vaque.md), a southern nobleman who leads the team representing ISF in the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), along with his teammates:
  * Alfred LeBeau,
  * Frederic Devereaux,
  * Jean de la Croix,
  * Robert Bachelet,
  * Sebastian le Courgis.
* Stroggik of Notar, a dwarven swordsfighter who uses a rather simplistic approach based on strength and wrestling techniques, which contrast the typically graceful, finesse fencing that ISF is known for.

### Former

* [Nathaniel](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Nathaniel.md), who retired as a fencer altogether after failing to win the ISF World Championship in the finals of the 1295 tournament, due to a controversial referee stoppage.
