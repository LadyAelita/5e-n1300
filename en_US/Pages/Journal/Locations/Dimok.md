**Dimok** is a city in the [Kingdom of Northland](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/The Kingdom of Northland.md), most well-known for being a hub of entertainment and commerce in [Iartar](Iartar.md). Having been the largest city on the continent for hundreds of years, it eventually was left behind by other, more rapidly developing Iartarian cities. It still remains frequently visited by tourists, though, especially during the festivities of [The Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md), which it hosts alternately with the southern capital of [Gerosion](Gerosion.md) once every 10 years.
