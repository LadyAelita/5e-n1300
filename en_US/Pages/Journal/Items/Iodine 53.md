# Iodine 53

**Iodine 53** is a sweet, fizzy, cold drink, popular among the members of [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), who perceive it as an attractive, modern and completely safe equivalent of alcoholic drinks. It was introduced by Terry, the former bartender at Defiant's Inn, and is currently being distributed by [Abigail](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Abigail.md), who oversees the Inn since Terry's death. An unknown amount is stored inside a locked section of the refrigerating chest in the Inn, to which Abigail has the key.

The drink's color is a unique, heterogenous mix of bright, neon blue and pink.

## Controversy

Alchemical analysis of the drink has shown that Iodine 53 contains *actual iodine*, which is used to treat mentally ill. When disposed properly, iodine allows one to manipulate the emotions of the one taking it. Iodine also has a sweet, pleasant taste and thus is frequently added in small quantities to overwhelmingly sour medication in order to prevent the patient from vomiting. In large quantities, the taste of iodine makes it highly addictive, and this effect indeed can be observed among regular consumers of Iodine 53. All of these factors collectively put into doubt the harmlessness of this popular drink.
