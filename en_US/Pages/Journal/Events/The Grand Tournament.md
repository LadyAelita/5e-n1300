**The Grand Tournament** is an international multi-day sporting event in which people from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. It's held once every 10 years, alternating between [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), [Kingdom of Northland](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Kingdom of Northland.md) and [Gerosion](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Gerosion.md), [Kingdom of Southland](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Kingdom of Southland.md). The period during which the tournament is considered holidays.

## History

The 1st Grand Tournament took place in 1020, as means of entertainment and in order to commemorate the great war that took place years prior to the event and denote the beginning of what is considered a golden era of peace and prosperity. The tournament was then estabilished as a reoccuring tradition in order to encourage great minds and mighty combatants to hone their skills even in the times of peace, lest the world order was threatened yet again.

## 28th Grand Tournament

The start of the 28th Grand Tournament in June 1300 was delayed due to the wait for arrival of [The Lich King](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Lich King.md) and [King Wyran I](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/King Wyran I.md) - according to tradition, rulers of both kingdoms must be present to officially open the event. This year, however, both were delayed, and an exception was made for the first time in history - while The Lich King has made it in time, Wyran's elder son, [Prince Wyran II](#!Pages/Journal/Characters/Prince Wyran II.md), has officially opened the festivities in his father's stead on the 15th of June.

## Competitions

Various competitions are held as part of The Grand Tournament festivities, including:

* **Music** competition.
* **Chess**, both two and three dimensional.
* **Fencing**, in form of the [ISF World Championship](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md) tournament.
* **Tactical card games**.
* A **team combat tournament** informally dubbed „The Team Games”, considered to be the main event.

## The Team Games

The Team Games is a round robin tournament, featuring pre-registered teams composed of 5 combatants each.

### Match rules

* The arena is enclosed in a multi-layered magical barrier, preventing outside interference and securing the audience and the city in general.
* Each team registers 5 combatants (and optionally a sixth one as a potential replacement), one of which is selected to be the captain.
* Each team can have an artistic performance during their entrance to the arena. The performers must then leave, save for those who are simultaneously a part of the team.
* Once the bell rings, both teams fight each other, anything goes, until all members of one team are dead, which is determined by the head of the referee committee, who orders to ring the bell once again, signaling the end of the match.
* Once a combatant dies, their souls are allowed to watch the remainder through a crystal orb on the Plane of Death.
* After the contest is over and the winners are announced, every combatant is provided instant healing and every dead combatant is fully resurrected (or reanimated in case of undead).

### Tournament rules

* The tournament is held under round robin rules, with each round taking place during a separate day.
* The match schedule is announced in advance, however the order of the matches within the given day is subject to change.
* A victory earns the winning team 2 points.
* A tie earns both teams 1 point.
* The team that has the most points after all matches have been decided, wins.
* If multiple teams have the same number of points, the following tiebreakers are applied within the group consisting of those teams:
	1. Wins against tied teams - the teams are ranked by the number of wins against other teams with the same score.
	2. Points difference - the teams are ranked by the total points scored minus points given up. For example, a team with a 1-2-0 record has scored 2 points and given up 4, so the difference is -2.
* If a registered participant assaults a registered participant from another team outside of a sanctioned match, the team of the assailant automatically loses all their remaining matches by disqualification and is forbidden from winning.
