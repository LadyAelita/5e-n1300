**Father Girard** was a parson of the Dionistic Temple in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md). For a brief period of time, he took care of [Reymar](Reymar.md)'s initiation into the [Dionistic Church](Nameless Keeper.md#Worshippers), personally overseeing his promotion from the rank of deacon to the rank of priest. He was shot by [the mystery murderer](The Murderer.md) in June, 1300, with Reymar bearing witness.

Around 1290, he converted [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) to Dionism and taught him how to read and write. However, as much as Baltrin's faith went on to become his primary virtue, Baltrin would end up heavily misinterpreting Father Girard's teachings and the tenets of Dionism in general.
