**Amanda of Dimok** is a swordsfighter, a tailor/leatherworker and one of the more recognizable faces of the [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) quasi-political faction, being the one who came up with their most recent name.

She currently competes for the [Iartar Swordsfighting Federation](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md), where she holds a record of 1-0-0, having had her first competitive contest during the ISF World Championship tournament, held as an attraction on the first day of the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament) festivities in Dimok, where she defeated a southern swordsman in under 6 seconds.

Along with [Brittany](Brittany.md), [Abigail](Abigail.md), [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) and [Matilde](Matilde.md), she's a part of the Defiant's Five, which is the third ever female-only team in the history of The Grand Tournament. Their goal is to become the first such team ever to go on and win the grand prize.

She also owns an apparel shop in the Defiant District, known for an extravagant, alternative, looks-over-comfort style, which has become synonymous with the faction.

## History

Amanda first met [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Factions/Infallible.md) in its original iteration of [Reymar](Reymar.md), [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) and [Kahrl](Kahrl.md) in early June 1300, when her [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) friends, [Brittany](Brittany.md) and [Rosemary](Rosemary.md), were seen painting graffiti on a [Malcolm](Malcolm Lefort.md) chapel, prompting Infallible to follow them. Although Kahrl mysteriously vanished, Reymar and Yalhra stayed in the Defiant District to talk to them. As a priest of a popular church, Reymar was initially met with mistrust by the young, progressive girls, but eventually earned a degree of respect and appreciation among them, due to his somewhat similarly chaotic attitude and his efforts toward punishing the priest that had wronged Rosemary in the past. Yalhra especially took a liking to Amanda's clothes shop, and Amanda let her take one of the free rooms in the shop's building as her own.

Outside of being seen training with Brittany or [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) (who technically went on to become a member of Infallible), Amanda didn't interact much with the protagonists until the 11th of June, 1300, when the Defiant Five bumped into the Infallible team, which was about to officially sign up for the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament) in the foyer of the City Hall. [Baltrin Arion](Baltrin.md), a member of Infallible, went into a verbal fight with Amanda, where both fighters taunted each other. Eventually, Amanda spat in Baltrin's face and walked away, which prompted Baltrin to recklessly throw one of his handaxes in her direction. The throw completely missed, though, and the axe knocked an innocent bystander out instead of the intended target, with Amanda audibly laughing at the orc from afar and loudly proclaiming she'd never miss like that.

## Personality

> A dozen of city guards surrounding me, I'd still take 'em all out without getting hit **once**. In high heels of course.
>
> – *Amanda*

Amanda is an arrogant, disrespectful and somewhat reckless individual. She often displays supreme confidence, believing that nobody could potentially defeat her in combat and that many problems can be solved simply through martial superiority. While being prone to making reckless choices, often starting conflict with anybody without second thought, she barely ever loses her cool, showing blatant disregard rather than uncontrolled frenzy to those who provoke her.

She swears quite often, also using a much more modern language than an average citizen.

Despite showing a total lack of respect to strangers, she cares about the people close to her, her smile being sincere rather than sarcastic when interacting with them. She also tends to be less disrespectful toward other women.

While she doesn't seem keen on following any rules, she's rational enough not to blatantly break them, instead bending them or abusing loopholes and technicalities. As an example, her spitting in [Baltrin](Baltrin.md)'s face was never a risk, given how she knew about his Infallible team not being officially registered as participants in the tournament. Even if this was considered an assault, it wasn't against a competitor, therefore Amanda's team wouldn't be disqualified. On the other hand, if it was the orc who'd respond with violence toward her (which he has, but thankfully for him, he missed), he could potentially be barred from registering.

She seems to quite enjoy using the runic devices. She owns a TSR phone, as per her announcement in the newspaper, where it was provided as one of the ways to contact her. She also has a radio receiver in her shop.

## Appearance

Amanda is easily recognizable due to her pale skin, black makeup and her sidecut hairstyle, combined with alternative apparel, based mostly on black studded leather, which doubles down as light armor - a modern style which she pioneered. She always wears a patch with a Defiant symbol on her jacket, as do many other members of the faction.

She also tends to wear high heeled boots despite already being tall, even in combat, which is generally seen as a baffling choice and a display of arrogance by other members of the fencing community.

## Abilities

Amanda is allegedly one of the best duelists, potentially in the world. Even though not much of that could be seen, outside of a few training sessions with her apprentice, [Brittany](Brittany.md), and her performance in a first-round tournament match, she was the dominant fighter on each of those instances. She defeated a southern swordsman, scoring a technical victory within seconds.

She was defeated by [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) during one of their training sessions, although he himself used to be arguably one of the best swordsmen in the world.

## Relations

### With Nathaniel

> Don't you **ever** take a swing at her ever again.
>
> – *Nathaniel do Baltrin regarding Amanda*

Not much is known about the nature of Amanda's relationship with [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md). Despite them living in vastly different districts of [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) and representing different teams on the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), their bond is evidently very strong and both lovers have had massive influence on the other. It is due to having become Nathaniel's only sparring partner in 1295, during the day of the [ISF World Championship](#!Pages/Journal/Factions/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md) tournament, that she became fascinated with fencing and dedicated her efforts to becoming the best at it. Meanwhile, Nathaniel's entire wardrobe is composed of apparel handmade by Amanda, and he does tend to swear in Common relatively often for a half-elf.

The typical male and female roles seem to be reversed in their relationship, with Amanda being an aggressive, brash, strong, no-nonsense fighter, and Nathaniel being a more amiable, soft-spoken and reasonable scientist, serving as the voice of reason and having mostly foregone fencing years ago, on top of his rather feminine appearance.

While Nathaniel is clearly confident in Amanda's toughness and combat prowess, he's very protective of her and doesn't like seeing her in any form of danger. He usually lays low in his efforts to protect her, doing so rather quietly. It wasn't until Amanda left the building, that he sternly and threateningly told [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) to never swing at her, even dropping his usual soft-spoken, somewhat apprehensive and panicky attitude. Moreover, Nathaniel has been evidently attempting to keep Amanda away from [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md), whom he sees as very dangerous, especially to her.

### With Brittany

> \- I'll beat you next time!
> \- That's what you've said the last time.
>
> – *Brittany and Amanda*

[Brittany](Brittany.md) treats Amanda as her mentor. She wears a very similar style of clothing, from studded leather, down to her signature high heeled boots, even including the same all-black makeup. The most striking differences are Brittany's straight platinum blonde hair contrasting with Amanda's jet black sidecut and Brittany being a few inches shorter.

While Amanda taught Brittany everything about fighting, Brittany's style is surprisingly vastly different to Amanda's, her weapon of choice being a scimitar in place of a rapier, and her movements being much more animated, emotional, reckless and chaotic. As was said in an overheard conversation between the two, Brittany has never managed to defeat Amanda when the two were training together.

### With Baltrin

> *(laughs)* I'd never miss like **that**!
>
> – *Amanda to Baltrin after his wildly missed axe throw*

Amanda and [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) are both arrogant fighters, each out to prove superiority over the other. Baltrin believes a barely adult girl is no match for a real fighter, let alone a mighty orc like himself, while Amanda likely sees Baltrin as yet another foe that overlooks her and whom she will humiliate.

So far, Amanda has had the advantage, having successfully taunted Baltrin, spitting in his face, disrespecting him and prompting him to recklessly throw an axe at her and miss wildly, publicly embarrassing the orc.

## Quotes

* „We're called *Change and Freedom*. But on the other hand... *Defiant* sounds so fucking cool, doesn't it?” - to Yalhra, talking about the name of her faction.
* „Well, fuck the murder stroke" - jokingly to Nathaniel during their training, as a response to him scoring a technical victory over her with his signature murder stroke maneuver.
