**Brittany** is a young fire mage, possibly a Prophetusa, affiliated with [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md). She is an amateur swordsfighter, training under [Amanda](Amanda.md). She's also [Rosemary](Rosemary.md)'s girlfriend.

## History

According to Brittany, she's ran away from her previous life, having been disowned by her parents, [Edmund](Edmund Claville.md) and [Ivette Claville](Ivette Claville.md). She's had an unpleasant confrontation with a priest of the [Nameless Keeper](Nameless Keeper.md), who has assaulted her on the grounds of her being a lesbian. Acting in self-defense, Brittany killed him using her magic. Later on, she went on to save Rosemary from a similar fate at hands of [Father Romuald](Father Romuald.md), although this time no blood was shed, as intimidation turned out to be enough.

She first met [Infallible](Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) in its original iteration of [Reymar](Reymar.md), [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) and [Kahrl](Kahrl.md) in early June 1300, when they saw her and [Rosemary](Rosemary.md) vandalizing [Malcolm](Malcolm Lefort.md)'s chapel with graffiti. The girls were then followed by them all the way to Defiance District.

## Personality

> I just like painting, especially in pink. Is there anything wrong with a huge, pink heart?
>
> – *Brittany to Infallible*

Brittany is always cheerful, especially in the presence of [Rosemary](Rosemary.md), on whom she always focuses most of her attention. She has very little regard for the rules, as she believes she isn't harming anybody by breaking them, in her case, through painting graffiti on public objects. She also likes to play with fire, at the same time consciously trying to avoid being too reckless with it, which according to her, has gotten her in trouble already.

Brittany does swear once in a while, but it's much less frequent compared to [Amanda](Amanda.md).

## Appearance

Brittany has pale skin, straight blonde hair, and wears black makeup, combined with alternative apparel, based mostly on black studded leather, which doubles down as light armor - her style is heavily inspired with that of her mentor, [Amanda](Amanda.md), even down to her signature high heeled boots, without which she is of average height. She always wears a patch with a Defiant symbol on her jacket, as do many other members of the faction.

## Abilities

Brittany was taught swordsfighting by [Amanda](Amanda.md), although she has developed a very different fighting style to her mentor's. Her weapon of choice is a duo of twin scimitars, and all of her movements are much more dynamic, aggressive, reckless and emotional compared to Amanda's.

She also has access to fire magic, which, according to her, she's acquired from a book. She clearly has very little arcane knowledge, leading one to believe that the book was merely a placebo, and she actually has innate power, making her a Prophetusa.

## Relations

### With Amanda

> \- I'll beat you next time!
> \- That's what you've said the last time.
>
> – *Brittany and Amanda*

Brittany treats [Amanda](Amanda.md) as her mentor. She wears a very similar style of clothing, from studded leather, down to her signature high heeled boots, even including the same all-black makeup. The most striking differences are Brittany's straight platinum blonde hair contrasting with Amanda's jet black sidecut and Brittany being a few inches shorter.

While Amanda taught Brittany everything about fighting, Brittany's style is surprisingly vastly different to Amanda's, her weapon of choice being a scimitar in place of a rapier, and her movements being much more animated, emotional, reckless and chaotic. As was said in an overheard conversation between the two, Brittany has never managed to defeat Amanda when the two were training together.

### With Rosemary

> I promised myself I'll never let anybody hurt her.
>
> – *Brittany about Rosemary*

Brittany spends most of her time with [Rosemary](Rosemary.md), the two being very close to each other both figuratively and literally, with Brittany being extremely protective of her. They practice swordsfighting together, but it looks more like the two dancing together rather than fighting, clearly not wanting to hurt one another. They also use wooden practice swords instead of sharp weapons, which Brittany and [Amanda](Amanda.md) use during training.
