**Yalhra** is a fire leed'he (half-elemental, half-human) Prophetusa Ultima and a founding member of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md). She's currently a member of [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), also representing them in the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament) as part of Defiant's Five.

## History

### Origin

Yalhra's origins and profession have never been addressed, although she seems to have lived in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) for at least an extended period of time.

### Infallible

She first met [Reymar](Reymar.md) in the [dimokian](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) crowd, mere moments before he was assaulted by a thief. She likely didn't want to accidently cause havoc and therefore just watched on as the thief ran away with his newly acquired treasure, before it was retrieved by [Darrius](Darrius.md), who went on to beat him up. Darrius took Yalhra's inaction as cowardice and clearly expressed his disgust toward such an attitude, claiming that the city didn't need people like her. By the same virtue, he started a fight with [Kahrl](Kahrl.md), whom he defeated and took hostage. Darrius agreed to let him free if him, Reymar and Yalhra all joined his quest at assembling a team for the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), leading to the birth of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md).

In order to assemble funds for the tournament, her and [Reymar](Reymar.md) decided to pursue bounties put on various criminals by the [Dimok City Watch](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), including [the mysterious shooter](The Murderer.md) and [the "banshee"](Amelia Kerraman.md).

When Infallible spotted [Brittany](Brittany.md) and [Rosemary](Rosemary.md) vandalizing a [Malcolm](Malcolm Lefort.md) chapel, they followed them all the way to the Defiance District, where Yalhra got to meet [Amanda](Amanda.md) and [Chloe](Chloe.md) while visiting their shop. Amanda allowed her to take one of the free rooms in the shop as her own, which Yalhra accepted, especially taking a liking to the radio receiver, which was a novelty to her.

During a confrontation with the "banshee", she turned to be the daughter of the [dimokian governor](Alfred Kerraman.md), [Amelia Kerraman](Amelia Kerraman.md), who became a vampire rather than a banshee. At one point, Amelia was seemingly poised to bite Yalhra's neck, but instead ended up merely kissing her cheek. Reymar didn't notice that and thus didn't stop his sword mid-swing, starting a fight with the vampire, who won very easily. Yalhra managed to convince her to let Reymar live, on the condition that Infallible pretend they don't know anything in front of the City Watch. Yalhra went on to become close friends with Amelia, voluntarily agreeing to the vampire regularly imposing nightmares on her, so that she could visit her in her dreams.

When visiting one of the less expensive inns in the city, Yalhra defended a student who was being bullied by a drunk man, eventually starting a brawl and getting knocked out. She was helped by [a man in a hat](The Man in a Hat.md), waking up on the floor in his house, despite there being a bed right next to her. He didn't answer any of her questions and told her the assistance was going to cost her everything she had in her sack of money. As he left, Yalhra began to explore the place, going down the stairs through an open door, but his servant caught her and told her not to do that. Yalhra went upstairs instead, trying to examine a book she found there, but was caught in the act once again by the exact same servant, who gave her the last warning and eerily disappeared before she even managed to turn around. When the man in a hat came back, he wrote something down in his book and then returned her sack to her. She realized he didn't take a single penny. He refused to explain, strongly suggesting her to leave, which she did. Upon leaving the house, to her own confusion, she suddenly found herself with the inn behind her back and the house nowhere to be found.

While visiting the City Watch headquarters, the captain's TSR phone rang, as [a teenager](Nyx.md) called the Watch on himself, admitting to having murdered his family. Infallible followed the patrol dispatched to that location, only to witness the killer easily vanquish the guards using shadow magic. After a while of difficult negotiation, the Watch's reinforcements, assisted by Reymar and Yalhra, managed to restrain and arrest him, leaving Infallible to further investigate the murder scene and provide a report to the Watch later on.

### Trouble with the law

When [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) visited [Alfred Kerraman](Alfred Kerraman.md)'s office, he asked them in detail regarding their investigation of the "banshee", whom he had known to be [his daughter](Amelia Kerraman.md). Yalhra didn't want to sell her friend out and tried to hide the actual outcome of their confrontation, but the governor saw through her lies and arrested her for protecting a dangerous, rogue monster. [Reymar](Reymar.md) got the [Dionistic Church](Nameless Keeper.md) involved as experts on creatures of the dark, later anonymously hearing her confession and officially absolving her of her sins in front of the [Watch's captain](Captain Bernard.md), leading to her release from prison.

Yalhra has since then been arrested once again for reasons currently unknown. The governor claims to have had another hearing with her, during which she blew the whistle on Reymar regarding how he got her out the previous time. In response, Reymar agreed to plead guilty, in exchange for the governor officially pardoning him and rewarding him with twenty thousand gold pieces under the table. The governor admitted that the confession will give him a stronger legal reason to personally take charge of her case and eventually take her to a mock court.

She likely got a pass to temporarily leave arrest in order to compete in the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), for the purposes of which she registered as part of the [Defiant's Five](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), jumping ship from Infallible with no explaination.

## Personality

Yalhra is a Prophetusa Ultima who has very limited control over her powers, which are triggered mostly by emotion. She tries her best to keep her composure and use her powers for good, but sometimes can't control herself, which leads to accidents.

To a sometimes oblivious degree, she has a friendly attitude toward creatures that would intimidate everybody else. She wanted to talk to [Amelia Kerraman](Amelia Kerraman.md) despite her being a vampire, leading to the two becoming good friends.

## Relations

### With Amelia Kerraman

> \- I will need you to trust me blindly on this one... do you trust me?
> \- I...
> \- *(kisses her on the cheek)*
>
> – *Amelia and Yalhra, with the latter expecting to get bit in the neck*

Yalhra has been obliviously trusting toward [Amelia](Amelia Kerraman.md) despite her being a vampire. Meanwhile, Amelia clearly has been eerily attracted to Yalhra from the first time they met. Amelia could have easily defeated both Yalhra and [Reymar](Reymar.md) in a fight, and she could have easily forcefully bite Yalhra and drink her blood, which she ceased to do, only talking to the leed'he and kissing her on the cheek instead. When Reymar dealt the first strike against Amelia, she fought her off and only at Yalhra's suggestion did she decide to spare him.

The two went on to remain close friends. As a vampire, Amelia has the ability to invade someone's dream, turning it into a nightmare in the process, and despite that side effect, Yalhra took the initiative and personally suggested that Amelia should regularly interrupt her dreams in that manner, so that the two can see each other.

### With Chloe

> \- That's so cool!
>
> – *Chloe to Yalhra regarding her friendship with Amelia*

[Chloe](Chloe.md) and Yalhra have grown close together, due to both of them living in rooms in [Amanda](Amanda.md)'s shop, effectively becoming housemates. As somebody who works with apparel, she gives Yalhra fashion advice, while Yalhra tells her the stories of her own adventures, which Chloe finds very exciting and fascinating, especially for the ones involving [vampires](Amelia Kerraman.md).

## Abilities

Yalhra's focus lies in her martial abilities - she mostly relies on strong, powerful strikes.

Aside from being a skilled fighter, Yalhra has access to the most rare kind of Prophetium, that being Prophetium Ultimum, which is visible through the products of her magic being tinted an unnatural color. Yalhra's Prophetium Ultimum color is silver.

As Prophetusa Ultima, she can have her spells burst through magical resistances with little effort.
