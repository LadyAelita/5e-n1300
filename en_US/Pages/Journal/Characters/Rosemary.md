**Rosemary** is a young girl from a small village of Wolfville near [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), from which she ran away. She's currently affiliated with [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), just like her girlfriend, [Brittany](Brittany.md).

## History

According to Rosemary, she was miserable in her village, notably due to the local [Dionistic](Nameless Keeper.md) priest, [Father Romuald](Father Romuald.md), illegally attempting an exorcism on her, nearly killing her in the process. She was saved from that fate by [Brittany](Brittany.md), who threatened to take the priest's life if he didn't back down. The two girls have since fallen in love.

She first met [Infallible](Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) in its original iteration of [Reymar](Reymar.md), [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) and [Kahrl](Kahrl.md) in early June 1300, when they saw her and Brittany vandalizing [Malcolm](Malcolm Lefort.md)'s chapel with graffiti. The girls were then followed by them all the way to Defiance District.

## Personality

[Rosemary](Rosemary.md) is usually very quiet, generally only talking to [Brittany](Brittany.md), who is very protective of her. She made it known that she's always wished to be a mage, although she dreads going to the university to become an Incantessa.

## Appearance

Rosemary has warm beige skin and long, raspberry hair. Her hair is naturally dark brown, but she's had it painted sometime during the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament). She's a few inches taller than [Brittany](Brittany.md) and her choice of clothing is more conservative compared to her girlfriend's, although she keeps introducing more alternative elements to her style one at a time, such as a red leather jacket, matching her hair color. She wears her [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) symbol patch on one of her dress belts.

## Abilities

She practices swordfighting along with [Brittany](Brittany.md), although they just end up mostly having fun and playing rather than actually improving their skills. She likely isn't proficient in combat.

## Relations

### With Brittany

> â€“ *Brittany about Rosemary*

Rosemary spends most of her time with [Brittany](Brittany.md), the two being very close to each other both figuratively and literally, with Brittany being extremely protective of her. They practice swordsfighting together, but it looks more like the two dancing together rather than fighting, clearly not wanting to hurt one another. They also use wooden practice swords instead of sharp weapons, which Brittany and [Amanda](Amanda.md) use during training.
