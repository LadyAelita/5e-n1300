**Leonard Laszlo** is a Knight of [Hell](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Hell.md), a Vilos, a former member of the [Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md) and the son of the infamous tyrant, [Laszlo I](Laszlo I.md). He's currently a member of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), having joined the team in order to win [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament) and earn an audition with the King of [Northland](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Kingdom of Northland.md), [Wyran I](King Wyran I.md), as he seeks to confront him regarding the death of his own father.

## History

### The Blood Order

Leonard Laszlo joined the [Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md) voluntarily, at around the same time as [Baltrin](Baltrin.md), and similarly to him, ended up frozen in a cryogenic chamber. Both of them were awoken nearly 300 years later. Seeing how Baltrin had attempted an escape, Laszlo tried to follow him, but was murdered during his brave attempt.

As part of a pact made generations in advance by his father, [Laszlo I](Laszio I.md), Leonard's soul was sent to [Hell](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Hell.md) after his death. After about a month of travelling across the infernal hellscapes, he managed to meet his father, who immediately orchestrated an escape plan for him. At the cost of last fibers of Laszlo I's existence, Leonard's soul was able to leave Hell and reunite with his body. In the meantime, only a few hours have passed on the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Terrestrial Plane.md).

Unfortunately for him, Laszlo was found by the same Blood Order unit that has just killed him. He asked for forgiveness, though, and the Blood Order members, impressed by what seemed like self-resurrection to them, agreed to take him back.

### The Second Defection

Years later, in 1300, Laszlo along with a [Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md) unit, most notably including his friend [Todd](Todd.md) and led by a Blood Order veteran in [Samael](Samael.md), was carrying out an escort mission for a dark elven fence. The elf was buying an immensely expensive data storage device from [Reymar](Reymar.md), who happened to be accompanied by [Baltrin](Baltrin.md), which marked the first time they met since Baltrin's escape. As it turned out, Baltrin has been suffering from memory loss and did not recognize Leonard.

After the exchange was completed, Samael began to berate Todd, who was very vocally voicing his desire for alcohol. Seeing it as the best opportunity to leave the Blood Order once and for all and reunite with another defector, Laszlo stood up for Todd and went on to turn on the Blood Order in the insuing skirmish, to which Todd responded by doing the same.

[Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), alongside Leonard and Todd, won the fight, killing Samael in the process, but a fireball spell thrown by Reymar set nearby houses on fire. The lack of access to any water magic prompted Laszlo to call upon [Agdoth](Agdoth.md), a frost demon from the [Abyss](Abyss.md). As the demon demanded to be told the reason for his summoning, Leonard introduced himself as the son of [Laszlo I](Laszlo I.md), under whom Agdoth had previously served. Leonard managed to trick the raging demon into a pact mostly beneficial to himself. Agdoth agreed to help Laszlo and be at his call until the dimokian governor, [Alfred Kerraman](Alfred Kerraman.md), lies dead.

With the help of the demon's frost magic, Laszlo stopped the fire and personally rescued the endangered citizens from the hazards of their houses falling into ruin.

### Infallible and the Destruction of the Blood Order

Laszlo would go on to join [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) to compete in the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament). As part of the grand prize, an audience with the King of [Northland](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Kingdom of Northland.md) was promised. He acquired historical knowledge regarding his father's death and got to know, that it was the current King of Northland [Wyran I](Wyran I.md) that had killed him, which prompted Leonard to seek an explaination. He would seek to put the King on the spot in front of tens of thousands of people of all nations that assemble the arena crowd. Laszlo also intended to summon Agdoth in battle, given how summoning creatures was not disallowed by the rules, which would provide Infallible with a significant advantage.

In the days leading up to the Tournament, Infallible was being attacked by [Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md) acolytes, with the attacks growing more and more difficult to fend off. Per Nathaniel's suggestion that the cult be destroyed, Laszlo joined the rest of Infallible in their assault of the [Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md) headquarters. He nearly died while fighting in the [Balment Library](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md), but was saved from returning to Hell by [Reymar](Reymar.md)'s revivifying prayer. Ultimately, [Belial](Belial.md) was defeated (and then killed by [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md)) and the Blood Order was destroyed in the process.

Leonard, as part of the Tournament, was invited to a banquet in [Alfred Kerraman](Alfred Kerraman.md)'s house and accepted the invitation, mostly due to the presence of many relatively powerful nobles whom he intended to scout and meet. He was escorted out of the building along with the other guests, when one of them, [Chloe](Chloe.md), was suspected of being [Amelia Kerraman](Amelia Kerraman.md) in disguise. As it turned out that the vampiric Amelia still managed to murder her father, Laszlo's pact with [Agdoth](Agdoth.md) came to an end.

## Personality

Leonard Laszlo is a stoic, calm and calculating person. He barely ever shows emotion and most frequently prefers to utilize silence over speech. He seems to put his goals above his personal pride, as he was the first to admit that the newly recruited [Shiro](Shiro.md) might be more useful in the arena than him. He generally avoids alcohol, purely due to reponsibility and being more effecient in achieving his goals while not intoxicated.

He seems to proudly wear his family crest, instead of trying to distance himself from his infamous family name, although at the same time he did opt for the inverted colors (red dragon on black background) when insisting that it become a part of the [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) coat of arms. It remains unknown what exactly did Leonard have in mind at that moment.

Despite being the son of [Laszlo I](Laszlo I.md), he seems not to have inherited much of his father's malevolent personality, as he did everything he could to protect the dimokian citizens from the fire that broke out. However, he clearly tricked [Agdoth](Agdoth.md) into an essentially one-sided pact, and he turned on his [Blood Order](Blood Order.md) teammates twice, which might raise suspicion, despite both Agdoth as a creature and the Order as an organization being clearly vile by nature. Also, while a Knight of Hell, he does not worship demons, instead seeing these creatures mostly as potential tools, allies and business partners rather than deities.

## Relations

### With Laszlo I

It's unknown what Leonard's relationship with his father, [Laszlo I](Laszlo I.md) was, but he's not trying to keep his legacy a secret and he probably appreciates the sacrifice that his father had commited for him.

### With Shiro

> – *Laszlo to Infallible regarding Shiro's recent recruitment for the Tournament*

As Vilosi affiliated with the conflicted planes of [Hell](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Hell.md) and [Void](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Void.md) respectively, Laszlo and [Shiro](Shiro.md) naturally repulse each other, even if they don't actively hate one another. Said repulsion is likely what prevents them from conversing with each other.

## Abilities

Laszlo has gone through both [Black Knight](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/The Black Knights.md) and Warlock training, thus he utilizes both might and magic in combat, while lacking a more focused approach with either of the two. The infernal pact that he had inherited from his father propels his luck and vitality, also providing him with his arcane weapon of choice - hellfire, as well as an ability to see in the dark.

Laszlo has proven to be the most proficient outside of typical combat scenarios. He possesses vast knowledge of magic, history, gods and demons. He's shown an ability to outsmart infernal creatures when making pacts with them. He's also the only person able to effectively suppress the influence of Curt's [Seal of Air](Seal of Air.md), utilizing the knowledge found in the [Balment Library](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md).
