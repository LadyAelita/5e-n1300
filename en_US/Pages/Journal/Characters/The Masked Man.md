**The Masked Man** is arguably the spiritual leader of [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), who conceals his identity behind a mask. 

He has strong influence over the faction, as nearly all of its members carefully listen to every word he says - for an anticlerical movement, they nearly religiously follow him. Despite such strong affiliation, his style doesn't resemble that of the other members, and he's the only member to never wear the faction's symbol on his clothing. Thus, both his membership and leadership over the group is very informal, even by the standards of an informal movement.

## History

The teachings of The Masked Man are what is said to have started the [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) movement in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), back in 1299, when it was yet to even have a name or any semblance of structure or leadership.

The Masked Man has first met [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), when he encountered [Reymar](Reymar.md) and [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) in one of their first visits to Defiant's Inn. He stopped Reymar as he was about to leave and began a conversation with him, referring to him as "Mr Cleric". Minutes later, he became the first target of [the mysterious murderer](The Murderer.md), although he managed to dodge the bullet on his own, leading to Terry becoming a collateral victim, as his head exploded. This prompted The Masked Man to ask Reymar for assistance with catching the murderer.

Their next encounter took place in a confessional of the [dionistic](Namless Keeper.md) temple in Dimok, when Reymar was hearing confessions during the mass. He clearly recognized The Masked Man from among the queue of confessors by his voice. The Masked Man then defiled the sacred ritual of confession, reciting a warped version of select lines from the official confession formula. He confessed that he has sinned, but boasted that he has no regrets and that he will not be punished despite of that. Afterwards, he conversed with Reymar about the murderer, vaguely warning him, that he believed the murderer "is closer to [Reymar] than [he] might expect", before leaving the building. The reasoning behind those assumptions remains unknown.

When Infallible, now consisting of Reymar, [Baltrin Arion](Baltrin.md), [Aithem](Aithem.md) and [Leonard Laszlo](Leonard Laszlo.md), were visiting Defiant's Inn to listen to [Abigail](Abigail.md)'s performance, The Masked Man happened to enter the building soon afterwards. He gave a speech, to which all members of Defiant have listened, except for [Brittany](Brittany.md), who seemingly ignored him.

The Masked Man has since sent a "gift" to [Reymar](Reymar.md), which was a spell scroll written in an unindentified language.

## Personality

> Father... I have sinned, but I do not seek thy forgiveness. I remember every single misdeed of mine, yet I do not regret any, at all.
>
> – *The Masked Man*

The Masked Man is most certainly an individual shrouded with mystery and eerieness. While he's attained the following of some, he invokes mistrust in others, such as [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md), who specifically considers him a danger to his girlfirend, [Amanda](Amanda.md). 

He is well-spoken and polite, notably referring to [Reymar](Reymar.md) as "Mr Cleric". Despite that, there seems to be a perpetual underlying malice in his voice, and his politeness seems to come from a place of vitriolic intent, often coming off as a sarcastic mockery. Even in the face of possibly considering [Reymar](Reymar.md) an ally, due to a common enemy in [the murderer](The Murderer.md), he still disrespected [his religion](Nameless Keeper.md) and made sure it was evident that he was enjoying every second of it.

The ideology that he preaches is mostly focused around rebelling against the system, strength in numbers and the downsides of religion.

## Appearance

The Masked Man dresses in a very modest, unspectacular manner, with his clothes too unshapely and tattered to even define clearly. The only element that stands out is his unsettling mask, which makes it much more difficult to read his intentions. Most of his body is covered by his outfit, effectively concealing many aspects of his identity, although his appearance is very humanoid. His size rules out the possibility of him being an orc or a dwarf, and had he been an elf, his ears would likely be too difficult to conceal, and his voice is rather deep, leaving one to believe he is a human, or at least half-human.

## Abilities

The Masked Man is a very skilled and charismatic talker, to the point where the ease with which he influences people seems supernatural. It currently remains unknown whether that's the case.

## Relations

### With Brittany

> Um, well, I mean... I wasn't really paying attention, probably the same old shit, "blah blah blah, [the king](King Wyran I.md) is bad, we are many, we are a legion". Like, whatever.
>
> – *Brittany about The Masked Man's speech*

[Brittany](Brittany.md) seems to be the sole member of [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) that absolutely disregards The Masked Man's speeches, not being impressed with him at all. She seems annoyed with him at times, although she doesn't act on that in any practical way.

### With Nathaniel

> No wonder why Nathaniel wants to keep this guy away from Amanda...
>
> – *Reymar to Baltrin, about Nathaniel's attitude toward The Masked Man*

[Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) clearly doesn't trust The Masked Man, as he finds him potentially dangerous. Given how close The Masked Man is to [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), Nathaniel is worried about his girlfriend, [Amanda](Amanda.md), who is another prominent member of that faction.

### With Reymar

> I wholeheartedly hope that our collaborative efforts shall bear fruit, Mr Cleric.
>
> – *The Masked Man to Reymar*

Despite apparently treating [Reymar](Reymar.md) as an ally in the investigation of [the mysterious murders](The Murderer.md), he definitely considers him an outsider and more of a business partner than a friend. He shamelessly disrespected [his religion](Nameless Keeper.md) and made sure it was evident that he was enjoying every second of it.

Simultaneously, Reymar seemingly agrees with [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) and considers The Masked Man to be a very suspicious and potentially dangerous individual.
