**Matilde** is an adept Incantessa, studying at the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md). Her primary specialization is Transmutation magic, Illusion being a secondary one. She's affiliated with [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) to an unspecified extent, representing them during the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament) as part of Defiant's Five.

## History

Matilde met [Reymar](Reymar.md) when he was traversing the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md) building in search for [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md). She was voluntarily working there as a receptionist, when regular staff took time off due to [The Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md) holidays, and she happened to know him relatively well.

She was also the one that accepted Reymar's application when he was signing up to join the university, recommending him the school of Transmutation as his secondary choice, based on how he intended to learn more about enchanting of items.

She signed up for the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), representing Defiant's Five, probably as a response to [Amanda](Amanda.md)'s announcement in the [The Northern Courier](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Northern Courier.md) newspaper, issue 1300-06-09.

## Personality

Matilde is a helpful and hardworking person, as shown by her working on the university voluntarily during holidays, when nobody else wanted to.

## Relations

### With Master Endurion

> She's a hardworking young lady.
>
> â€“ *Master Endurion about Matilde*

[Master Endurion](Endurion.md) was one of the people in charge of registration at the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md), and thus he appreciates her volutnary assistance at the office, especially given how she's much more mobile and full of energy than him.

### With Nathaniel

Matilde and [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) certainly know each other well, but they aren't the closest of friends.

## Abilities

The details of Matilde's magical prowess isn't known, although she's clearly ahead of most of her colleagues, given how she signed up for [The Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md).
