**Kahrl** is an orcish psi-warrior, who was initially affiliated with [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) before mysteriously disappearing.

## History

> It's a big city, you need to defend yourself.
>
> – *Kahrl to Reymar*

Kahrl's origin isn't known, outside of the fact that he was "looking for his master".

He first met [Reymar](Reymar.md) and [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) in the dimokian crowd, mere moments before he was assaulted by a thief. He didn't react to that, letting the thief run away. The thief was quickly captured by [Darrius](Darrius.md), who went on to beat him up. He then shamed Yalhra and Kahrl for not taking any action. Kahrl ended up in a fight with Darrius and lost, being taken hostage by him. Darrius agreed to let him free if him, Reymar and Yalhra all joined his quest at assembling a team for the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), leading to the birth of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md).

Kahrl aided Infallible in some of their early investigations and helped remove Defiant's graffiti from a wall of a vandalized temple of [The Guardian of Frost](Guardian of Frost.md). He disappeared shortly thereafter.

## Personality

> I enjoy killing.
>
> – *Kahrl*

Kahrl was very blatant about finding enjoyment in inflicting death upon others. He seemed not to care about the well being of others at all.

## Abilities

Kahrl is a psi-warrior focused on martial arts and a practitioner of the monastic tradition of Long Death. He's skilled with unarmed strikes and is able to sap the vital forces of his enemies with a touch.
