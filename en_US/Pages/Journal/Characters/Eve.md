**Eve** is the battle construct created by [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) for the purposes of the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament). Eve is officially a member of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md). She has been assigned the female gender due to her fighting style, which involves more dexterity than strength.

## History

> I don't need to be strong, if someone strong fights for me.
>
> – *Nathaniel to Darrius, regarding Eve*

Eve has been Nathaniel's passion project that he's been developing over the course of a few years. However, the progress that he's been able to make on his own has been insufficient. It wasn't until [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) bought into the project, funding it with large sums of money, that he was able to make Eve work. In return, Eve and Nathaniel were to join [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) for the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament).

## Abilities

> \- "Eve"? Why "Eve"?
> \- While both strong *and* fast, the golem's fighting style is focused much more on... speed. She fights like a fencer, and fencing is graceful. Thus I thought a female name was fitting.
>
> – *Baltrin and Nathaniel*

Eve is very mobile and knows how to find openings in the enemies' defense. Her program was based on Nathaniel's own swordsfighting style from the past, and fencing in general. At the same time, as a steel construct, she's very resilient and posseses a lot of pure strength.
