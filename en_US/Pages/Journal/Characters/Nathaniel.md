**Nathaniel** is a member of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), a long time student at the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md), an exceptionally talented runic engineer, the creator of [Eve](Eve.md) and a former elite swordsman. He's [Amanda](Amanda.md)'s boyfriend and her trainer, constantly seeking to destroy [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md) for endangering her. He's also the arguable architect of the the [Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md)'s destruction.

## History

### Swordsfighting career

Fencing was Nathaniel's first passion in life, and it turned out to be one of his many talents, as he managed to qualify for the [ISF](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md) World Championship Tournament in 1295. On the eve of the tournament's first round, as he was practicing on his lonesome, devoid of a sparing partner, he was approached for the first time by a curious, 16 years old [Amanda](Amanda.md), who offered to assist him in his training, despite having no fighting background herself. Nathaniel went on to achieve a lot of success in the tournament, advancing to the finals with a string of dominant victories. 

He lost the final match to [Master Illithor](Illithor.md) in controversial fashion, as the referee stopped the contest, having erroneously believed Nathaniel was knocked out, whereas Nathaniel immediately recovered and achieved what should have amounted to a technical victory, had the match still been ongoing. The technical victory did not count, due to the contest having been ended mere seconds earlier. The referee's decision was deemed final and the ISF World Championship was awarded to Illithor. Nathaniel, enraged with the outcome, retired from swordsfighting shortly thereafter.

### Studies at the University of Magi

Intending to pursue arcane studies, yet unable to afford moving to the capital city of [Northland](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Northland.md), Nathaniel decided to instead enroll into the local [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md). Despite hiding his Prophetus talents for unknown reasons, he was still achieving impressive results, with the sole exception of [Master Xardimon](Xardimon.md)'s class devoted to the element of Darkness. Nathaniel especially excelled at runic engineering, which he took a liking to and began to study in his free time, quickly surpassing even the Masters. His engineering talents have been recognized and let to him working for [King Wyran I](King Wyran I.md) himself on the recent project of an automated royal guard, for which he wrote software and designed the firearms. He also began work on a personal project, seeking to create [an intelligent humanoid construct](Eve.md).

When dealing with the firearms, Nathaniel accidentally discovered potential destructive properties of diamonds, which were commonly used only for resurrection magic. This prompted him to do further research and write a dissertation on this topic as part of his studies. Despite his thesis having been accepted, at that point he still did not manage to pass [Master Xardimon](Xardimon.md)'s class, failing every single attempt at the final exam. Due to the statute of the Dimokian University, he was forced to retake all the other classes, despite having passed all of them multiple times.

Nathaniel was growing increasingly frustrated with the rules yet again undermining his undertakings. This frustration reached a boiling point when the [Guild of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Guild of Magi.md) refused to keep his paper confidential and made it publicly available to anyone who requested (as all student theses are), despite it being a potentially dangerous discovery if it fell into wrong hands. This cemented Nathaniel's anti-systemic attitude.

### Reunion with Amanda

While still attending university classes, he was doing so mainly out of habit. Soured on all kinds of science, Nathaniel managed to finally reunite with [Amanda](Amanda.md), which resulted in her becoming the main focus in his life, as the two were clearly in love. He began to train her in swordsfighting, passing all his knowledge, despite not intending to go back to that profession himself. This led to her pursuing the [ISF](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md) World Championship on the upcoming [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament).

As Amanda went on to become the face of the [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) movement and the originator of a new fashion trend, during the months leading up to the tournament, Nathaniel identified [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md) (arguably the founder of Defiant) as a potentially dangerous influence on her. She began to share those worries upon realizing that she was is unable to act on that suspicion due to a strange mental barrier. This prompted Nathaniel to personally investigate Defiant, The Masked Man and the topic of mind control in general, and served as the catalyst for the grand feud between The Masked Man and himself.

### Joining Infallible

Weeks before the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), Nathaniel was approached by [Reymar](Reymar.md), who was trying to recruit him for their [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) team for the purposes of winning that year's [Team Games](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#The_Team_Games). [Darrius](Darrius.md) was the one that specifically suggested Nathaniel as the new member, due to having seen his swordsfighting performance 5 years prior. Darrius' opinion of Nathaniel drastically changed in an instant, though, when Nathaniel declined the invitation, citing being retired from fencing, not being in shape and not feeling like fighting as the reasons.

Eventually, Nathaniel agreed to join Infallible, but not as a combatant. He suggested that he make use of his prior research and finish his [humanoid construct](Eve.md), similar to the automated royal guards he had worked on, to fight in his stead on the arena, as long as Reymar and his companions manage to acquire funding for that.

### The Destruction of the Blood Order

As Nathaniel's [personal project](Eve.md) was nearing completion, [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) found themselves in a feud with [The Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md), due to their allegiance with [Baltrin Arion](Baltrin.md), and later [Leonard Laszlo](Leonard Laszlo.md) and [Todd](Todd.md). The group was being attacked by squads of assassins, growing in size and strength with each attack. Nathaniel himself was contacted by the Blood Order in his house in University District. The cult offered to help him free [Amanda](Amanda.md)'s mind from [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md)'s influence, in exchange for him leading Infallible into the Blood Order's trap. Tempted by the offer, but ultimately reluctant to trust them and betray his teammates, Nathaniel instead conjured his own complex gambit, intended to lead to the Blood Order being destroyed and [Belial](Belial.md) himself forced to aid Nathaniel.

Nathaniel informed the Blood Order that he agreed to their proposal. He let [Reymar](Reymar.md) in on his plan and then purposefully leaked a different version of his own plan out, which was also the version that he presented to Infallible as he was suggesting that they destroy the Blood Order once and for all. Knowing that he was now being observed by the Blood Order's invisible Observers, he pretended to visit [Little Frank](Little Frank.md). The Blood Order believed that he was seeking to illegally buy enough magical scrolls, grenades and potions to secure his team's triumph despite the Blood Order's overwhelming numbers. In the meantime, it was Reymar who secretly acquired the proper supplies from [Greg](Greg.md) when he wasn't being watched. This would lead to the Blood Order preparing themselves against attacks that never came, then being caught off guard by Reymar's hidden arsenal of artifacts.

Infallible let themselves get caught and teleported to [the Ruins of Balment Keep](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md), only to break free and begin the raid on the stronghold. Nathaniel kept eliminating the invisible Observer patrols thanks to his specialty monocle and his modified crossbow. The plan was being executed successfully until Nathaniel, [Amelia Kerraman](Amelia Kerraman.md) and Todd found themselves separated from the rest in the Citadel, forcing them to take a different path - one through the Temple. They managed to enter the lower levels of the headquarters and catch up at the last possible moment. Just as [The High Priest of Blood](The High Priest of Blood.md) was about to finish off the other squad, Nathaniel shot him in the skull, as Amelia and Todd charged into melee. Before his eventual demise, the High Priest managed to grab a piece of sharpened beryl ammunition from Nathaniel's crossbow and stab Amelia in the heart with it, which would have killed her if it wasn't for her allies' immediate assistance.

In the Balment Library, Nathaniel got into an argument with Infallible's newest ally in [Curt](Curt.md). Curt did not want to agree to fight Belial trying to merely subdue him, announcing that he would strike to kill. Nathaniel protested, stating that was not the plan, but that he couldn't reveal more by any circumstances. Curt did not trust him and insisted on knowing, which prompted Nathaniel to draw his rapier, leading into a brutal fight between the two. Reymar kept trying to split them, but to no avail. Ultimately, Nathaniel defeated Curt, as both combatants utilized invisibility, but Nathaniel saw Curt the whole time through his monocle, of which Curt was not aware. As Curt was distracted by Nathaniel's fake clone, the real Nathaniel snuck up behind him and stabbed him with an [onyx dagger](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Onyx dagger.md). While this would have normally been a lethal blow, Curt survived thanks to his [Seal of Air](Seal of Air.md) taking him over. A possessed Curt proceeded to wreck havoc until Laszlo suppressed the Seal.

During Infallible's fight with Belial, Nathaniel's plan came into fruition. [Ny'lha](Ny'lha.md) bound a flying Belial to the ground with a conjured water tentacle. The God of Lies was weak enough for Nathaniel to use his Cádal, instantly putting Belial to sleep, as Reymar put an adamantine collar around Belial's neck. Afterwards, Nathaniel read an arcane scroll containing a geas spell, forcing Belial to obey his commands. As Belial woke up and was likely going to cooperate due to the geas placed on him, the returning [Aithem](Aithem.md) killed him using his [soul-stealing rapier](#!Pages/Journal/Items/The Soul-Stealing Rapier.md) before he could reveal the information that [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) was after. Then, Aithem would reveal himself to be The Masked Man in disguise, prompting Nathaniel to furiously charge him with a lightning blade spell. The Masked Man calmly left Belial's throne room, shutting the gate with telekinesis, denying Infallible passage long enough for him to escape.

### The 28th Grand Tournament

As [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) returned to [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) to celebrate the Blood Order's destruction, Nathaniel remained anxious. Both him and [Curt](Curt.md), would rather pursue The Masked Man than rest, which alleviated the earlier conflict between them, especially given how Curt got to know what Nathaniel's plan and motivation had been all along. Taking a walk to the Glory & Shame Museum, he revealed to Curt that he was feeling overwhelmed by regrets and fear.

Nathaniel prepared radio communication devices for the team, which he designed based on the sending stones found in [Balment Keep](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md). Serving as the team's captain, he provided tactical insight, taking advantage of his vantage point from the stands. Infallible went on to defeat [Iartarian Swordsfighting Federation](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md)'s team in their first tournament match.

During their second match against the Vitriol team led by [Aiden](Aiden.md), Infallible seemed to have secured an enormous lead, having eliminated every combatant aside from Aiden. [Curt](Curt.md) was nearly eliminated by [Liam](Liam.md), but the [Seal of Air](Seal of Air.md) took him over, leading him to obliterate Liam in a few seconds. However, Aiden managed to isolate [Eve](Eve.md) from the rest of the team, distracting the others with an illusion of himself. Holding a bottle of tsavoritic acid over the prone construct, he threatened to destroy her permanently, prompting Nathaniel to throw in the captain's flag, forfeiting the match for his team. Aiden emptied the bottle on Eve regardless, reversing the decision and disqualifying his own team from the tournament, but destroying Eve in exchange. Throughout the combat, Aiden also managed to utilize his unique acid magic to permanently damage [Baltrin](Baltrin.md)'s and [Reymar](Reymar.md)'s valuable sets of armor.

## Personality

> I just... I feel like maybe I should have sided with the Blood Order, then this wouldn't have happened. But it's always like this, right? The grass is always greener on the other side. And it's not at all easy for me to say that either. It's not like I could have just betrayed everyone and then sleep at night as if nothing happened.
>
> – *Nathaniel to Curt regarding the events in [Balment Keep](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md)*

Despite his tendency to speak in a somewhat panicky and chaotic manner, Nathaniel has shown on multiple occasions that he can be calm and calculating as well. This has become a rare occurrence, though, as his mental condition has deteriorated due to his personal war with [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md). While he had displayed supreme belief in his plan of destroying the [The Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md) and binding [Belial](Belial.md) with a geas, he has since shown very little confidence in any actions he's about to take or has already taken, admitting to feeling constant regret. He's also become clearly much more prone to losing his cool, breaking down or acting on emotions alone.

The bad streak of his experiences with the accepted sets of rules has led him to believing that the rules are nonsensical. He hates many aspects of the current system, although his interest in fighting for change has severely diminished, as he focused his attention on creating a comfortable situation primarily for himself and [Amanda](Amanda.md), above everyone else. He's not entirely selfish, though, having admitted that he'd have felt guilty had he sold [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) out, despite not having close relationships with anyone in that group.

## Abilities

Over his entire life, Nathaniel has proven to be skilled in numerous trades, although he also tends to give them up very quickly. Once arguably the best swordsman in the world, now, while still proficient, he retains only a fraction of his dueling skills. Instead, he helps his efforts through engineering and magic, relying on subterfuge moreso than pure combat prowess or destructive arcane might.

His favorite swordsfighting technique is the murder stroke, which involves holding the sword by the blade and using its pommel or guard as a hammer, hitting the enemy in the head.

Having worked on automated royal guards and their firearms and having designed and created [Eve](Eve.md), he is knowledgeable about automation and ballistics. His main weapon during the raid on [Balment Keep](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md) was a modified hand crossbow, suited to shoot sharpened gemstone ammunition, ruby and beryl in particular.

As a Prophetus Ultimus, he possesses innate arcane abilities, which he uses very rarely in its purest form, mostly due to the intention of keeping this talent a secret. He was known in the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md) for having little talent for magic, but in turn being well versed in theory and runic engineering. This talent of his was fully on display for the first time when [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md) spoiled his plan of getting [Belial](Belial.md) to aid him. An apoplectic Nathaniel attempted to charge his nemesis with a lightning blade spell which not only injured his own arm, but also manifested itself in form of purely pink electrical arcs.

A part of his Prophetus Ultimus talent is his Cádal power word, which he is able to use twice a day, and which either puts someone into a deep coma or awakens them. He used it to incapacitate and later awaken [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) to ease the tension in an escalating argument. In [Balment Keep](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md), he used it in a similar manner against [Belial](Belial.md), setting him up for a geas. The activation of Cádal sees him execute the somatic component, as he speaks the word and his eyes glow pink. The manifestation is difficult to notice, which makes Cádal an ability well suited for use without revealing his Prophetus Ultimus nature.

## Relations

### With Abuyin

It's unknown how exactly had Nathaniel met [Abuyin](Abuyin.md), but during the inauguration of the academic year in the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md), the legendary lich clearly recognized him and the two had a casual conversation.

### With Amanda

> Don't you **ever** take a swing at her ever again.
>
> – *Nathaniel to Baltrin regarding Amanda*

Few details are known about the nature of Nathaniel's relationship with [Amanda](Amanda.md). Despite them living in vastly different districts of [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) and representing different teams on the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), their bond is evidently very strong and both lovers have had massive influence on the other. It is due to having become Nathaniel's only sparring partner in 1295, during the day of the [ISF World Championship](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartar Swordsfighting Federation.md) tournament, that she became fascinated with fencing and dedicated her efforts to becoming the best at it. Meanwhile, Nathaniel's entire wardrobe is composed of apparel handmade by Amanda, and he does tend to swear in Common relatively often for a half-elf.

The typical male and female roles seem to be reversed in their relationship, with Amanda being an aggressive, brash, strong, no-nonsense fighter, and Nathaniel being a more amiable, soft-spoken and reasonable scientist, serving as the voice of reason and having mostly foregone fencing years ago, on top of his rather feminine appearance.

While Nathaniel is clearly confident in Amanda's toughness and combat prowess, he's very protective of her and doesn't like seeing her in any form of danger. He usually lays low in his efforts to protect her, doing so rather quietly. It wasn't until Amanda left the building, that he sternly and threateningly told [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) to never swing at her, even dropping his usual soft-spoken, somewhat apprehensive and panicky attitude. Moreover, Nathaniel has been evidently attempting to keep Amanda away from [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md), whom he sees as very dangerous, especially to her. Amanda is aware of The Masked Man's corruption, but due to [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md) having already compromised her free will, she cannot act on that knowledge, only being able to helplessly shed tears.

Nathaniel prioritizes Amanda over everyone else, having referred to her as the only person he's got.

### With Curt

Nathaniel and [Curt](Curt.md) disliked each other initially - they attempted to kill one another in a skirmish in [Balment Library](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment Keep.md). It wasn't until Nathaniel was able to reveal his feud with [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md) that they began to respect each other due to having a common nemesis. Their uneasy alliance began showing cracks once again, though, when Nathaniel forfeited a tournament match on behalf of his entire team including Curt. This led to Curt being frustrated with his decision and giving Nathaniel no confidence in his role of the team's captain.

### With The Masked Man

> Die!
>
> – *Nathaniel, charging The Masked Man with a lightning blade spell*

Nathaniel despises [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md). Given how close The Masked Man is to [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), Nathaniel's girlfriend, [Amanda](Amanda.md), has fallen under his influence by drinking [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md). Nathaniel himself has been suffering from psychological trauma as a result of his feud with The Masked Man, a battle in which he feels helpless, outmatched and quite often isolated, and his condition has been getting worse ever since his failed quest to forcefully acquire aid from [Belial](Belial.md).
