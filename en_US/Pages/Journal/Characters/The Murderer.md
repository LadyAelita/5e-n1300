The dimokian **mystery murderer** is an unknown creature that has been committing a series of murders in the city of [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), starting June 1300.

## Personality

The mystery murderer might be appreciative of music or art in general - all of his murders seemingly follow the theme of a certain song, lyrics to which were found written in blood of each victim by the immensely precise bullets. The murderer has also never attempted to target the same person twice, even if the target survived.

## Abilities

The murderer has been using a type of a ranged ballistic weapon. The gun is rumored to be magical, due to having been suspiciously precise and powerful, being able to shoot bullets through minute holes in walls. The bullets always hit the target directly in the head, effortlessly piercing right through, and so far nobody has survived being shot. The angle of impact was always perfect enough for the blood of the victim to burst out of the back of their head, forming a readable writing on the wall.

Seconds before every murder, the weapon has produced a unique, audible, high-frequency sound. So far, two would-be victims have avoided that fate due to the sound being noticed: [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md) ducked the bullet in the last second, causing it to instead hit Terry, the innkeeper of the [Defiant Inn](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), and [Darrius](Darrius.md) was saved in his own home by Reymar noticing the sound and pulling him out of the way in the neck of time, resulting in a bottle of wine being hit.

## Victims

### 1. The Masked Man (survived)

This attempt at [The Masked Man](The Masked Man.md)'s life was witnessed by [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) in the [Defiant Inn](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md). The Masked Man ducked the bullet, probably having heard the sound.

### 2. Terry the Innkeeper

The Defiant innkeeper, Terry, has involuntarily took a bullet intended for The Masked Man, who has managed to move out of the bullet's trajectory. The writing on the wall said "**Blame the sinners**".

### 3. Father Girard

The bishop of the dimokian [Dionistic Church](Nameless Keeper.md) has been shot and bled to his death right before [Reymar](Reymar.md)'s eyes, just as he was about to leave [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) in order to go on „an important mission”. The bloody text said "**Blame the saints**".

### 4. Ivor the Dealer

One of the local drug dealers, wanted by the Dimok City Watch, was the next victim. Infallible hasn't witnessed that death in person, but have been informed about it by the Watch and it has been farther confirmed in the [The Northern Courier](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Northern Courier.md) newspaper, the 1300-06-09 issue.

### 5. Barrett Leveille

A journalist working for the [Northern Aether](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Northern Aether.md) radio station was murdered next, per both the station and The Northern Courier.

### 6. Darrius (survived)

Due to Infallible deciphering the song, they have managed to arrive at [Darrius](Darrius.md)' place in time, enabling Reymar to hear the sound and pull Darrius out of the bullet's trajectory. The bullet pierced a random bottle of wine instead, with the contents forming a writing on the wall that said "**Blame the fisher**", suggesting that Infallible's prediction was correct.

### 7. Gaston of Dimok

The Northern Courier's 1300-06-09 issue has reported a few days of relative safety, which induced hope that the murderer has given up. However, as was reported in it, the day before the paper's release, the murderer has returned with yet another victim added to the list. This time it was Gaston of Dimok - „*a politician and the leader of a major intercontinental blacksmith guild*", as he was described in the sheet.

## The Song

According to [Abigail](Abigail.md), there exists a relatively popular bard song *„Bullet”*. The writings in blood have matched certain lyrics of the song, indicating that there might exist a theme that the murderer has been following. The analysis of the lyrics has allowed [Reymar](Reymar.md) and [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) to save [Darrius](Darrius.md) from being yet another victim.

Among various theories regarding the identity of the murderer, there was one suggesting it's a golem/earth elemental, due to the lyric in the chorus saying „*My heart is made of stone*”, although this is just as likely to be a metaphor.

### „Bullet”

*It's a fine line, between courage and fear*
*You can't see the ghosts, but you know that they're here*
***Blame it on the sinners***<sup>(1)</sup>*, **blame it on the saints***<sup>(2)</sup>
***Blame it on the pills***<sup>(3)</sup> *they're pouring down their cheek*
***Blame it on the truth***<sup>(4)</sup>*, lies you trapped away*
***Blame it on the fisher***<sup>(5)</sup>*, but all they want is fame*
*Didn't see it coming, didn't see the signs*
*Didn't see tomorrow stare right in their eyes*

*I, I'll never be scried*
*The wicked live and the good ones die*
*Time, time, we're out of time*
*We all kill to survive*

*I will take a bullet for you*
*My heard is made of stone*
*I will take a bullet for you*

***Blame the politicians***<sup>(6)</sup>*, the corporations too*
*Blame it on the immigrants, cause they don't look like you*
*Blame it on the money, blame it on the fame*
*Blame it on the love and fools that play that game*

*Blame it on your father, for leading you astray*
*You can keep on running and he can't make you stay*
*Never wore a doublet, never once a gown*
*Blame it on the weary head that wears the crown*

*I, I'll never be scried*
*The wicked live and the good ones die*
*Time, time, we're out of time*
*We all kill to survive*

*I will take a bullet for you*
*My heard is made of stone*
*I will take a bullet for you*
