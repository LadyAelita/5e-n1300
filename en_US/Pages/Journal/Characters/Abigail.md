**Abigail** is a bard affiliated with [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) and the current innkeeper of the Defiant Inn, where she regularly performs and takes care of distribution of the [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md) drink.

## History

Not much is known about Abigail's past, other than her being a wandering bard.

She first met [Reymar](Reymar.md) of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) in early June 1300, when he found her walking around hidden under a full, hooded cloak, nearby the crime scene, mere minutes after [Father Girard](Father Girard.md) was shot by [the mysterious murderer](The Murderer.md), raising suspicion that she herself was the shooter. He apprehended her before the [Dimok City Watch](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) managed to, lying to the patrol that he had seen her attempting to vandalize the walls of his church and insiting that the [Dionistic Church](Nameless Keeper.md) punished her instead. Initially, she was expecting to actually be punished by the Church for no reason, immediately responding with aggression and spite, rightfully claiming she hadn't committed any vandalism and wasn't going to do so, and then calling Reymar out for discriminating her based purely on her looks and allegiance. Eventually, Reymar managed to get her to calm down, explaining how he just saved her from becoming an official suspect regarding the murder that just took place, given how she looked extremely suspicious. He also convinced her to aid Infallible in finding the murderer, suggesting that she might just as well be the next victim.

Later on, Abigail would hand Infallible the written down lyrics to the [„Bullet”](The Murderer.md#The_Song) song, which coincided with the murders, believing that the murderer might be following that theme.

Abigail also declared her participation in the music competition at the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament).

After the death of Terry, who used to be Defiant Inn's innkeeper, she is the one that seemingly informally took over his duties, with her being the only one who has the keys to the refrigerator with [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md).

## Personality

> I'm gonna burn this theatre down.
>
> – *Abigail about the music competition*

Abigail is an extremely fierce, defiant, artistic, emotional and driven person. She's perpetually serious, only occasionally resorting to humor in form of sarcasm. She's very clearly confident that she'll shock the world during the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament). Despite her drive, she seems not to value her own life, admitting not to truly care about the possibility of being murdered. She only decided to pay attention to [the mysterious murderer](The Murderer.md) after realizing she would prefer to continue her existence at least long enough to prove that she's the best musician in the world.

Despite being largely sceptical towards religion, Abigail seems to have some kind of respect for prophecies, especially those presented through art, such as the irehonian [Flames of War](#!Pages/Journal/Music/Flames of War.md) song. She's disapprovingly mentioned how the irehonian [Legacy](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Legacy.md) team didn't even recognize that song being played despite it having been the irehonian anthem.

## Abilities

Abigail plays a guitar which doesn't have to be tuned and produces an eerily reverberating, multi-layered sound, which suggests that it might be magical. However, when [Aithem](Aithem.md) has attempted to use her guitar, it didn't sound up to par, even compared to a regular acoustic guitar, let alone a magical one, suggesting that Abigail herself aids her performances with her own magic.

She also enjoys drinking [Iodine 53](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Iodine 53.md) excessively often.
