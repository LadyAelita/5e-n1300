**No-one** is [Reymar](Reymar.md)'s retainer and a former member of [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), which he left in order to convert to [dionism](Nameless Keeper.md), having been inspired by Reymar. He's on a path of redemption and flagellation, seeking to atone for his sins through self-inflicted suffering.

## History

### Defiant

No-one used to be a member of [Defiant](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md), infamous for performing flashy tricks with his sharp, magic knife. On one occasion, he cut one of his fingers in the process. [Reymar](Reymar.md), a [dionistic](Nameless Keeper.md) priest, approached him, as he begged for somebody to heal his wound. Reymar cauterized it in response, to which the knife guy reacted with anger, going on a very emotion-driven anti-religious rant, claiming that Reymar didn't heal him harmlessly with his magic, because his god isn't real and thus he has no magic.

When he witnessed Terry's death at the hands of [the mysterious shooter](The Murderer.md), he said it "looked cool".

### Conversion

One day, under the [dionistic temple](Nameless Keeper.md) in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md), "the guy with the knife" approached [Reymar](Reymar.md), accompanied at the time by [Baltrin](Baltrin.md), with a new, extremely humble and selfless attitude. He exposed his newly shaved head, having stripped himself of all that had defined him in the past, seeking atonement for his past sins. Baltrin was quick to take advantage of that and berate him for having been a "heretic". Reymar accepted his conversion, and asked him for his name, to which he replied that his name doesn't matter, just as his existence. Reymar went on to name him "**no-one**".

From that point on, No-one would accompany Reymar, obediently following his every order, even after Reymar was relieved of his duties as priest of the [Nameless Keeper](Nameless Keeper.md), in order to pursue a career as a [guild](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Guild of Magi.md) Incantator, studying at the  [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md).

## Personality

> I have sinned. Now, I shall suffer... so that others don't have to.
>
> – *No-one*

Back when he was "the guy with the knife", No-one used to be an immature, radical, anti-religious rebel, who seemed to just repeat what others said, rather than formulating his own arguments. He called Terry's gory death "cool", but later brought up that Terry didn't deserve to die, claiming that [Reymar](Reymar.md)'s [god](Nameless Keeper.md) doesn't exist, yet simultaneously doesn't care about people like Terry or himself. He also asked for assistance with his wound, but reacted with anger to receiving it, given how it was a priest who helped him.

Ever since his conversion, No-one has been ascetic in his approach to life. He has forgone every last fiber of his individuality, claiming himself as unimportant and deserving of suffering for his previous behavior, to the point where he remained completely stoic when [Baltrin](Baltrin.md) was insulting him. He also regularly flogs his own flesh during his prayers. He is completely loyal to Reymar, whom he considers his mentor, and whose orders he follows without question. The only time he shows any modecom of anger or initiative to act on his own is when his faith is being disrespected or challenged, showing willingness to defend it.

* „My old name bears no weight. My existence itself bears no weight, thus I do not deserve a name, for I am no-one in the face of [God](The Nameless Keeper.md).” - to Reymar, asked about his name.
