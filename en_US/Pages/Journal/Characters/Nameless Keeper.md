**The Nameless Keeper** is a greater deity of preservation, light and humanity and ruler of the [Plane of Light](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Light.md). The Keeper oversees the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md), as part of [The Terrestrial Trinity](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/The Terrestrial Trinity.md), although from among the Trinity, it's considered to be his personal domain specifically. He's the most commonly worshipped deity on [Iartar](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Iartar.md).

## History

During [Genesis](#!Pages/Journal/Events/Genesis.md), the Nameless Keeper was a human warrior, fighting on the side of [The Two](The Two.md) against the demonic armies of [The Six](The Six.md). He was seen as a hero, said to have led his side to victory against impossible odds.

After [The Sovereign](The Sovereign.md) had ambushed [The Guardian of Frost](The Guardian of Frost.md), leading to the [Edge of Endlessness](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Edge of Endlessness.md) falling into the [Corridors of Chaos](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Aether.md#Chaos), the sword was discovered by The Nameless Keeper, as it found its way into the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md). The Keeper would go on to wound The Sovereign with it, which forced the Demon King to yield.

As the last battle of Genesis concluded, The Guardian of Frost ordered the Keeper to lead all of his people into the [Plane of Light](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Light.md), then relinquish the Edge of Endlessness, so that the Guardian could destroy the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md). The Keeper refused, instead suggesting that there is more to this world than chaos and corruption. He said that the human race was born on this land, and thus they should be allowed to make it their home, proposing that he himself look after it.

The Keeper's suggestion was supported by The Sovereign, who, on the other hand, saw the Terrestrial Plane as fertile ground for spreading corruption and suffering, and thus he did not want to see it annihilated, let alone by someone other than himself. The Guardian found himself outnumbered and agreed to the terms. The three negotiated and threatened each other, until a consensus could be achieved. [The Terrestrial Trinity](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/The Terrestrial Trinity.md) was eventually formed, with the Nameless One ascending to godhood and becoming the realm's god-protector, ruling from [Plane of Light](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Light.md).

## Divine realm

The Nameless Keeper's divine realm consists of both the [Plane of Light](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Light.md) and the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md), with his immediate residence being found in the city of [The Harbor](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Harbor.md) in the Plane of Light.

## Personality

The Nameless One is completely devoted to protecting the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md), to the extent that he was willing to temporarily ally with [The Sovereign](The Sovereign.md) in order to preserve its existence and defy an order from [The Guardian of Frost](The Guardian of Frost.md), whom he had served loyally up until that point - the Keeper's loyalty is to the people of the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md). As forgiving and merciful as he is, he is just as willing to fight those that try and bring his place of birth to ruin.

## Relations

### With The Guardian of Frost

The Keeper used to be a loyal soldier of the Frozen Lord. He disobeyed him, however, when the Guardian announced his intent to annihilate the [Terrestrial Plane](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/The Terrestrial Plane.md), using his own creation in the [Edge of Endlessness](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Edge of Endlessness.md) against him. Despite the negotiations coming to a conclusion, they have been at odds ever since. While the Nameless One represents life, the Guardian of Frost represents death.

## Worshippers

The Church of the Nameless Keeper is also called *"The Dionistic Church"*, with the entire religion named *"Dionism"*. 

The followers are dedicated to (mostly) peacefully spreading their religion and providing aid for those in need. They also seek to actively compromise evil organizations, cults and creatures in general, although this is usually done with aid of various knight orders associated with the Church, most notably the Order of Light and the Order of the Shield.

### Beliefs

The Dionistic Church primarily preaches the promise of an afterlife on the celestial [Plane of Light](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Plane of Light.md), as long as one lives their life in accordance with Dionistic tenets. While its followers doesn't deny or doubt the existence of other **deities**, they follow the idea that *"there is only one **God**"*, which refers to how, according to Dionists, no other deity could possibly truly and sincerely care for the Terrestrial Plane and its people as the Nameless One does.

### Millitary orders

There exist two notable orders affiliated with the Church of the Nameless Keeper.

#### The Order of Light

*The Order of Brothers of the Aeonian Flame of the Nameless One's Temple in Dorgoth*, also known as **The Order of Light**, is a Dionistic millitary order estabilished in the 6th Century, initially headquartered in [Dorgoth](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dorgoth.md). Their primary purpose was to protect the faithful, so that no persecution happens ever again. Furthermore, the Order went on to thwart the ambitions of the necromancer [H'roll](#!H'roll) at the end of the 6th Century, using the famous holy warhammer, the [Bane of the Undead](#!Pages/Journal/Items/Bane of the Undead.md). The order's holy mission ended up attracting many [iartarian](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Iartar.md) knights and was supported by the Dionistic Church, which led to forts being constructed all around Iartar under the Order's banner, greatly expanding it's influence.

The Order of Light still functions as of year 1300 and is currently led by [King Wyran](Wyran I.md)'s younger son, [Prince Nacass of Northland](Nacass of Northland.md), who holds the title of the Order's Grand Master.

#### The Order of the Shield

*The Order of Defenders of the Dwarven Banner in Notar*, also known as **The Order of the Shield** was founded in the 11th Century, shortly after the conclusion of [Laszlo's Conquest](#!Pages/Journal/Events/Laszlo's Conquest.md), at the suggestion of Trodd, the previous Grand Patriarch of the [dwarves](#!Pages/Journal/Races/Dwarves.md). Trodd had seen it as a disgrace that the dwarves did not play a part significant enough throughout that war, and thus it was their duty to atone and ensure they will not remain indifferent, should history repeat itself.

The Order of the Shield's primary purpose is not different than that of the Order of Light - protect the faithful and actively combat evil.

### History

The term *"Dionism"* comes from the south of [Iartar](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Iartar.md), where The Nameless One was called *"Dion"*, meaning *"The Child of Heaven and Earth"*. Given how the High Elves of Iartar are known to have worshipped him as far back as during the ancient times, it's likely that they have spread Dionism onto the southern part of the continent. While it remains unknown when exactly did the human followers of The Nameless Keeper first start appearing, there exist records of a semi-organized religion in human-ruled states from as far back as the early 4th Century. However, at that time, under the [occultist](#!Pages/Journal/Races/The Demons.md) [Iartarian Empire](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Iartarian Empire.md), the Dionists were being persecuted. Soon after the Iartarian Empire fell, the official Church was created.

Dionism kept spreading at a steady, albeit slow rate. The Nameless Keeper became the supreme deity for those that worshipped the [Iartarian Pantheon](#!Pages/Organizations/Iartarian Pantheon.md). However, such faith was being largely forsworn in favor of [titanism](#!Pages/Journal/Races/The Titans.md). It wasn't until the 10th Century that the Dionistic Church saw a rapid growth, which led to it becoming the world's most popular religion. Eventually, by the 14th Century, a significant part of iartarian population has converted to [Lazarism](The Guardian of Frost.md#Worshippers). Both the Dionistic and Lazarian churches began to work together in the north of Iartar, as The Unified Northlandic Church.

### Organization

The Dionistic Church divides all lands under its influence into *dioceses*. Each diocese is based around a major settlement, also enclosing the surrounding villages. Dioceses are then divided into *congregations*, where each congregation is based around a single Dionistic temple or chapel.

Each congregation consists of its *priests* and *deacons* and is overseen by one of those priests, called a *parson*. Each diocese is governed by a *bishop*.

All of the Church's bishops make up the Council of Bishops, which regularly meets to discuss matters of importance. The council proceedings are administered by one of the bishops, who holds the title of the *archbishop*.

Despite being separate organizations, the Order of Light and the Order of the Shield both have representation in the Council of Bishops. Each order is represented by its Grand Master (the head) and all of its Knight-Captains. Given how the Order of the Shield holds only one keep, while the Order of Light is in possession of several, the voices of those organizations are far removed from being equally powerful.

During times of crisis, the Church would often temporarily bestow absolute power upon the Grand Master of the Order of Light.
