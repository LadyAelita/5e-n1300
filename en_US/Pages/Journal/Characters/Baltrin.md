**Baltrin Arion** is an orcish mercenary and a [dionistic](Nameless Keeper.md) zealot. He's a member of [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), having joined them mostly because of [Reymar](Reymar.md), who was a dionistic priest himself. He suffers from amnesia and doesn't remember a large chunk of his past.

He has a notable scar on his temple. It's a result of him being hit with an axe, which is the last thing he remembers, having likely led to his loss of memory.

## History

### Origin

Baltrin was born during the [Battle of Herlis Forest](#!Pages/Journal/Events/Laszlo's Conquest.md#Battle_of_Herlis_Forest), as the son of The Great Chieftain, [Bagrag](Bagrag.md). As [Laszlo](Laszlo.md)'s army began to overwhelm Bagrag's, an elite irehonian stealth team composed of [Antoine](Antoine.md), [Aetoris](Aetoris.md) and [Fingolfin](Fingolfin.md), was ordered by Bagrag to leave the battlefield and secure the safety of his son. The team had to leave Antoine behind when he injured his leg, as they were all trying to escape the battlefield. Nonetheless, Aetoris and Fingolfin successfully brought Baltrin away from the chaos.

A few days later, [Daivsel Vain](Daivsel Vain.md) managed to intercept the team after they had entered Irehonia. He nearly succeeded in assassinating Baltrin, but was ultimately thwarted by Fingolfin and Aetoris. As Daivsel was calling for help from his men, the sole remaining from among his soldiers revealed himself to have been Antoine in disguise, stomping on Daivsel's head to finish him for good.

The reunited team decided to take Baltrin to [Balment](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Balment.md), so that he could live his life in disguise as a regular peasant, within the borders of his fatherland, with the rest of them protecting him from the shadows. As they were approaching the village, they were ambushed yet again, this time by a squad of Laszlo's [Black Knights](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Black_Knights.md). The knights, however, were easily defeated by unexpected reinforcements in form of [The Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md).

Antoine, Aetoris and Fingolfin collectively accepted the invitation to join The Blood Order, as it promised safety for them and Baltrin.

### Joining the Blood Order

After [Laszlo's Conquest](#!Pages/Journal/Events/Laszlo's Conquest.md), Baltrin was one of the few surviving orcs. Having reached adulthood, he voluntarily joined [The Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md). Undisclosed experiments were carried out on him and he was then frozen in a cryogenic chamber, where he spent nearly 300 years. In year 1285, he was awoken, but attempted to leave the Order by escaping. He lost his memory of all prior events in his life, due to being hit with an axe by an unknown assailant. Afterwards, Baltrin met [Father Girard](Father Girard.md), who taught him basic skills, such as reading and writing, and converted him to Dionism in the process. Baltrin, however, understood Girard's teachings in his own, twisted way. He went on to become a mercenary, in order to hunt various monsters and criminals, all of which he saw as unholy. This was the closest he could get to satisfy his desire for slaying "heretics" without breaking the law.

### Arrival in Dimok

Baltrin traveled to [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) to fight in the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament), which he saw as an opportunity to legally slay "heretics", given how his knowledge regarding the tournament rules was very limited and thus he was not aware of every slain combatant being resurrected afterwards. He chose the local [Dionistic](Nameless Keeper.md) temple as the first place to visit, meeting [Reymar](Reymar.md), one of the priests and deciding to join forces with him, and by association, with [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), during the tournament.

Upon leaving the church, Baltrin and Reymar encountered [the guy with the knife](No-one.md) whose ire Reymar had drawn during his previous visit in the Defiant's Inn. It turned out he had converted to Dionism, stripping himself of all that had defined him in the past, and now approached Reymar seeking redemption, with a new, extremely humble and selfless attitutde. Baltrin was quick to take advantage of that and berate him for having been a "heretic".

While accompanying Reymar in the [Dimokian University of Magi](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Dimokian University of Magi.md), asking [Aiden](Aiden.md) for assistance, he irritated the wizard with his behavior. The two also encountered [Endurion](Endurion.md), who claimed to have seen "a... special kind of wisdom" in Baltrin, which the orc understood literally.

Soon thereafter, Baltrin learned about the recent assassination of his mentor, [Father Girard](Father Girard.md), from the 1300-06-09 issue of [The Northern Courier](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Northern Courier.md) newspaper.

### Feud with the Blood Order

Baltrin assisted [Reymar](Reymar.md) in carrying out various deals on the black market, as part of gathering funds for the tournament. During one of such deals, Reymar was selling [a very expensive, stolen solid state drive](The SSD.md) to a buyer found by [Little Frank](Little Frank.md). Baltrin wanted to destroy the device, but Reymar was ultimately against it. It turned out that the buyer, a dark elven mage loyal to ["The King"](The King.md), was accompanied by a unit of members of [The Blood Order](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Blood Order.md), including [Samuel](Samuel.md), [Todd](Todd.md) and [Leonard](Leonard Laszlo.md). Samuel very specifically wanted to kill Baltrin, whereas Todd suggested getting their payment, leaving in peace and getting drunk in an inn. Meanwhile, Leonard also recognized Baltrin and decided to turn on the other Blood Order members, with Todd joining him. During the fight, Reymar killed Samuel with a shatter spell, but Baltrin still beheaded his corpse afterwards just to make sure. [Belial](Belial.md) then spoke through Samuel's corpse, announcing that "[he] shall regain what was taken from him", potentially referring to Baltrin himself.

When Leonard revealed himself as the son of the legendary dictator and conqueror [Laszlo I](Laszlo I.md) from three hundred years ago, he mentioned Baltrin also being born in that bygone era, as he remembered him being a member of The Blood Order at the time. This was news to Baltrin, who had no memory of those events.

Baltrin later helped the [Dimok City Watch](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md) fend off the Blood Order troops assaulting the Glory & Shame Museum. During a fight with a Blood Order mage, he fell victim to a fear-inducing spell, which brought visions of the same axe that carved out his scar years ago. Despite that, Infallible managed to defeat the Blood Order once again.

When the [Defiant's Five](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Defiant.md) bumped into the [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) team, which was about to officially sign up for the [28th Grand Tournament](#!Pages/Journal/Events/The Grand Tournament.md#28th_Grand_Tournament) in the foyer of the City Hall, Baltrin went into a verbal fight with [Amanda](Amanda.md), where both fighters taunted each other. Eventually, Amanda spat in Baltrin's face and walked away, which prompted Baltrin to recklessly throw one of his handaxes in her direction. The throw completely missed, though, and the axe knocked an innocent bystander out instead of the intended target, with Amanda audibly laughing at the orc from afar and loudly proclaiming she'd never miss like that. Baltrin was nearly arrested by the City Watch afterwards, but [Captain Bernard](Captain Bernard.md) happened to pass by and had the patrol let him go.

While staying in The Silver Herald, Baltrin almost got murdered in his sleep by a Blood Order assassin. [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md), now joined by [Aithem](Aithem.md), have been assaulted by Blood Order troops in numerous alleys on their way to [Amelia](Amelia Kerraman.md)'s presumed hideout. The Order was deemed too dangerous to ignore, prompting [Nathaniel](Nathaniel.md) to propose the genocide of The Blood Order, to which Baltrin agreed.

### Raid on the Blood Order's headquarters

When discussing assault plans with [Amelia Kerraman](Amelia Kerraman.md), whom [Infallible](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Infallible.md) have asked for assistance, as suggested by [Reymar](Reymar.md), Baltrin got into an argument with the vampire, who in response nearly took his life, at which point the orc yielded.

## Personality

> Lower the price!
>
> – *Baltrin to a merchant*

Baltrin is a reckless individual, who likes to solve problems with violence or intimidation. He is very quick to jump to conclusions and to judge people by first impression. He hates "heretics", which is a label that he recklessly applies to people with very little logic behind it. He is easily angered by people that have a different opinion.

During the assault on the Blood Order's base, Baltrin got stuck in a corridor which turned out to be a trap, filled with disorientating mist, which ended up slowing Infallible down. In the middle of a combat later on, he tossed an alchemical fire, prompting the arrival of reinforcements from nearby rooms, which would have likely remained unaware of Infallible's presence otherwise.

He also has a tendency to assign his own, weird names to objects, such as "hah-doo-doo" for [one particular solid state drive](The SSD.md).

## Relations

### With Amanda

> *(laughs)* I'd never miss like **that**!
>
> – *Amanda to Baltrin after his wildly missed axe throw*

[Amanda](Amanda.md) and Baltrin are both arrogant fighters, each out to prove superiority over the other. Baltrin believes a barely adult girl is no match for a real fighter, let alone a mighty orc like himself, while Amanda likely sees Baltrin as yet another foe that overlooks her and whom she will humiliate.

So far, Amanda has had the advantage, having successfully taunted Baltrin, spitting in his face, disrespecting him and prompting him to recklessly throw an axe at her and miss wildly, publicly embarrassing the orc.

## Abilities

Baltrin is a powerful and aggressive warrior, able to dish out serious punishment with his battleaxe. He's also able to perform a magic detection ritual and knows how to utilize basic magic in order to empower his strikes. The exact nature of his magic is unknown.

He also knows the Lucernal language, in addition to Common and Orcish.
