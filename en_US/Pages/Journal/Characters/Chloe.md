**Chloe** is the checkout girl working at [Amanda](Amanda.md)'s shop in the Defiance District in [Dimok](#!Pages/Journal/Locations/Dimok.md).

## History

She met [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) when she, along with [Reymar](Reymar.md), followed [Brittany](Brittany.md) and [Rosemary](Rosemary.md) to the Defiance District and Yalhra decided to visit [Amanda](Amanda)'s shop.

She posted an announcement in the 1300-06-09 issue of [The Northern Courier](#!Pages/Journal/Organizations/Northern Courier.md) newspaper, where she was looking for a proficent lawyer to assist her with tax issues.

## Personality

Chloe is always cheerful and excited. She admits to having trouble with tax collectors due to having no bureaucratic knowledge. She is seemingly obsessed with vampires (and generally undead), having suggested to Yalhra that they could be integrated into society if enough people volutnarily donated their blood on a regular basis.

## Relations

### With Yalhra

> \- That's so cool!

> â€“ *Chloe to Yalhra regarding her friendship with Amelia*

Chloe and [Yalhra](Yalhra.md) have grown close together, due to both of them living in rooms in [Amanda](Amanda.md)'s shop, effectively becoming housemates. As somebody who works with apparel, she gives Yalhra fashion advice, while Yalhra tells her the stories of her own adventures, which Chloe finds very exciting and fascinating, especially for the ones involving [vampires](Amelia Kerraman.md).
