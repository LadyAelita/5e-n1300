[gimmick:title](Order of Combat)

# Order of Combat

The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn.

The order of turns is determined at the **beginning** of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls **initiative**. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the **next round** if neither side has defeated the other.

## Combat in steps

1. **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
2. **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers' marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are--how far away and in what direction.
3. **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.
4. **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
5. **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

## Surprise

If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other and there is no surprise. Otherwise, each combatant on one of the sides makes a **Stealth** check against the **passive Perception** score of each combatant on the opposing side. Those that detect **none** of the stealthly foes start the fight **surprised**.

A **surprised** creature **cannot do anything** on their first turn of combat and cannot take reactions until the first round ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.

## Initiative

When combat starts, every participant makes an Initiative roll to determine their place in the initiative order. Most of the time, this is just a regular Dexterity check of **d20 + Dexterity modifier**. 

Combatants are ranked in order **from** the one with the **highest** Initiative total **to** the one with the **lowest**. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, specific ability **scores** (not modifiers) of individual creatures are compared, until one of the numbers being compared is higher than the other - then the creature with the higher score wins the tie. The order of the tiebreaking abilities is **Dexterity**, **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, **Charisma**, **Constitution**, **Strength**.

The GM will often make one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.

## Your turn

On each individual turn of yours, you can take **all** of the following:

* a **movement**,
* a **main action** (also known simply as **action**),
* a **bonus action**,
* a **reaction**,
* an **interaction**.

You can also forgo doing some, or any of the above.

**Hint:** **Never** just **do nothing**. If you want not to do anything, at least take a **Dodge action** instead.

### Movement

### Main actions

### Bonus actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. You can take a bonus action **only** when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise **don't have a bonus action to take** - this is the **default** state.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified.

Anything that deprives you of your ability to take **actions** also **prevents you** from taking a **bonus action**.

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a **reaction**. A reaction is an **instant response to a trigger** of some kind, which can occur **on your turn or on someone else's**. 

The **opportunity attack** is the most common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you **can't take another one until the start of your next turn**. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature **can continue its turn** right after the reaction.

### Interactions

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with **one** object or feature of the environment **for free**. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a **second** object, you need to **use your action**. Some magic items and other special objects **always require an action** to use, as stated in their descriptions.

The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.
