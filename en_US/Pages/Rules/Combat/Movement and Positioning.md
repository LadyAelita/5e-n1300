[gimmick:title](Movement and Positioning)

# Movement and Positioning

Every creature has a **speed**, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round (**1 square tile** has a side of **5 feet**). This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.

You don't need to spend the entirety of your speed when taking your movement. However, the unused movement goes to waste as you end your turn.

## Diagonal movement

On **each turn**, **the first** time you move onto a tile diagonally, costs you **5 feet** as with vertical or horizontal movement. **Each subsequent** instance of that costs you **7 feet** instead.

## Difficult terrain

Some of the terrain you encounter might be considered **difficult terrain**.

Moving **1 foot** in difficult terrain **costs 2 feet** of movement, basically meaning you move at half speed. 

Whether you're moving through difficult terrain or not is determined by the **destination** tile. Moving 5 feet from a regular tile **onto a difficult terrain tile** costs **10 feet** of movement. Meanwhile, moving the same 5-foot distance from a difficult terrain tile onto a regular tile costs 5 feet of movement as per usual.

Another creature's space counts as difficult terrain for every other creature.

## Other types of movement

A creature may have many speed values, each for a different kind of movement. For example: climbing, flying or swimming. If the creature is said to have a certain speed, without any further descriptors, it's asssumed to just be regular, **walking** speed.

### Climbing, Swimming, Crawling

When climbing, swimming or crawling, **each foot** of movement **costs 1 extra foot**. In most scenarios it results in the creature moving half as fast as normally. This penalty is applied in the same manner as the difficult terrain penalty, as in, whether it applies or not is determined by the **destination** tile.

Some creatures might have an explicitly defined **climbing** or **swimming** speed. These creatures don't suffer from the described penalty and just use their speed approperiate for the situation.

### Jumping

You can spend movement to jump. There are two types of jumps and their distance is determined by your **Strength**.

#### Long Jump

When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet **up to your Strength score** if you **move at least 10 feet on foot** immediately before the jump. When you make a **standing** long jump, you can leap only **half that** distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Athletics check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Acrobatics check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone. 

#### High Jump

When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to **3 + your Strength modifier** if you move at least **10 feet on foot** immediately before the jump. When you make a **standing** high jump, you can jump only **half that** distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make an Athletics check to jump higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms **half your height** above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can **reach** above you a distance equal to the **height of the jump plus 1½ times your height**.

### Flying

A creature can only fly if it explicitly has a flying speed specified.

If a flying creature is knocked **prone**, has its speed **reduced to 0**, or is otherwise **deprived** of the ability to **move**, the creature **falls**, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the Fly spell.

## Breaking up your move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed  before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30  feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

### Moving between actions and attacks

There are no restrictions regarding how you are allowed to split your movement and actions. For example, having 30 feet of movement and an attack action allowing you to make 3 attacks within 1 round, you can: make an attack, move 20 feet, make 2 more attacks against a different target, move an additional 5 feet, use your bonus action and choose not to spend your remaining 5 feet of movement.

### Mixing different types of movement

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from your new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.

**Example:** If you have a walking speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60, because a wizard cast the Fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

## Creature size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space, as described in the table below.

| Size       | Space                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Tiny       | 2 1/2 by 2 1/2 ft.     |
| Small      | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Medium     | 5 by 5 ft.             |
| Large      | 10 by 10 ft.           |
| Huge       | 15 by 15 ft.           |
| Gargantuan | 20 by 20 ft. or larger |

### Space

A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5‐foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

### Squeezing into a smaller space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature **one size smaller** than it. For example, a **Large** creature can squeeze through a passage that's only **5 feet** wide.

While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend **1 extra foot** for **every foot** it moves there, and it has **disadvantage** on **attack** rolls and **Dexterity** saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.

## Moving around other creatures

You can move through a **nonhostile** creature's space, although it counts as **difficult terrain** for you. In contrast, you can move through a **hostile** creature's space **only** if the creature is **at least two sizes larger or smaller** than you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you **can't** willingly **end your move in its space**.

If you leave a hostile creature's **reach** during your move, you **provoke an opportunity attack**.

## Speed reduction

Some spells or other special effects may reduce your speed by a certain amount. Once such an effect ends, you **immediately regain** all your speed that you've lost within the current turn to that specific effect.

**Example:** Your regular speed of 30 feet is halved due to a wizard casting the Slow spell on you, meaning you've lost 15 feet of movement to that effect. If you move 15 feet, leaving you at 0 speed at the time, and then you attack that wizard, hitting and killing him, you suddenly regain your missing 15 feet of movement and are able to spend it within the same turn.

### Area-of-effect slows

There also exist a few effects of this nature which affect creatures only as long as they remain within a defined area of effect (such as the Spirit Guardians spell).

Entering the area of such an effect immediately reduces your speed by the given amount. If doing so would have resulted in you having a negative speed value after including the reduction, you **cannot get in**.

**Example:** Standing just outside of the area of Spirit Guardians, if you have 15 out of 30 feet of movement left, moving into an affected tile would see you spend 5 feet of movement, leaving you at 10 feet. Applying a speed reduction of 15 feet would then leave you with -5 feet of movement, which is not allowed. Therefore, you cannot move into the affected tile.

In other words, to be able to move into a tile that's part of an area of an effect halving your speed, you must have at least **half your regular speed + 5 feet** of movement left (or **half your regular speed + 10 feet** if the target tile is also difficult terrain).

### Stacking speed penalties

Multiplicative or additive speed reduction and difficult terrain are treated seperately, and therefore they **do stack**. Same goes for climbing, swimming or crawling, which make your movement cost **extra** feet. Doing either of those activities, while additionally in difficult terrain, results in **1 foot** of actual movement costing entire **3 feet** of your speed.

However, if an effect makes it so that 1 foot of movement costs a **specific** number of feet, rather than an extra number of feet, it **does not stack** with difficult terrain. In that case, your character **is** considered to be on difficult terrain, but you only apply **the most severe** penalty of this type.

**Example:** You're in an area that's already difficult terrain for you, which means every 1 foot you move costs 2 feet of movement. A hostile druid casts Wall of Thorns. The spell's description reads "*For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement.*". These effects don't stack on top of each other, so the net result is that for every 1 foot you move, you must spend **4 feet** of movement. Then you get knocked down prone and can only **crawl** to move. Crawling makes it so that each foot of movement costs an extra foot. In that instance, you'd need to spend **5 feet** of movement to move 1 foot.

**Multiplicative** speed reduction (as in, "your speed is halved" or "you move at a quarter of your speed") **can stack**, although many of such effects simply make use of the **slowed** condition, and multiple applications of the same condition **do not stack**.

**Additive** speed reduction (as in, "your speed is reduced by 10 feet") **does stack** and it's applied **before** the multiplicative reduction. If present, bonuses of respective type are applied along with penalties of the same type.

**Example:** Your regular speed is 30 feet. You have magical boots which increase your speed by 15 feet. You're encumbered, meaning your speed is reduced by 10 feet. You're under the effect of a Slow spell, which imposes the slowed condition on you. You've been hit with a Ray of Frost cantrip, which reduces your speed by additional 10 feet. You've been also subject to a Cold Nova spell, which imposes the slowed condition on you again. The net additive modifier is 15 - 10 - 10 feet, which is -5 feet, leaving you with 25 feet of movement. The slowed condition does not stack, therefore it's only applied once despite two instances of it affecting you. It halves your speed. Half of 25, rounded down, is **12 feet**, which is your final speed. Dropping a heavy item to get rid of the encumbrance would instantly restore **10 feet** of your movement, while removing **both** sources of slow by killing them would restore **13 feet**.
