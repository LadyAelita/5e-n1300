# Cover

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

Bonuses to AC resulting from cover apply both to regular and touch AC.

| Degree of cover    | Benefit                                                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Half**           | +2 AC and Dexterity saves                                    | A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. |
| **Three-quarters** | +5 AC and Dexterity saves                                    | A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. |
| **Full**           | Can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, can still be hit by some AoE spells | A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. |
