[gimmick:title](Mounted Combat)

# Mounted Combat

A willing creature that is **at least one size larger** than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.

## Mounting and dismounting

Once during your move, you can **mount** a creature that is **within 5 feet of you** or **dismount**. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to **half your speed**.

## Controlling a mount

While you're mounted, there are two options. You either control the mount on your turn, or it can act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, always act independently, but if they voluntarily obey your orders, you still get to control them on their turn.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has **only three** action options: **Dash**, **Disengage**, and **Dodge**. A **controlled** mount can move and act **even on the turn** that you **mount** it.

**Hint:** If you mount a creature, you basically start using their movement rather than yours, meaning you might still be able to move - either on your turn or your mounts turn, depending if it's controlled or independent - even if you've just depleted your personal movement speed in order to mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take.

## Opportunity attacks

If **the mount provokes** an opportunity attack while you're on it, the **attacker can target you or the mount**.

## Getting knocked off

If an effect **moves** your **mount** against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity** saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're **knocked prone while mounted**, you must make the same saving throw.

If your **mount** is **knocked prone**, you can use your **reaction** to dismount it as it falls to try and land on your feet by making a **DC 12 Acrobatics** check. Otherwise, you are **dismounted** and **fall prone** in a space within 5 feet it.
