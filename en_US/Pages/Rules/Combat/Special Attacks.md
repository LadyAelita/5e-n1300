[gimmick:title](Special Attacks)

# Special Attacks

There exist certain **special attacks** that can be attempted by any character **in place** of a regular attack.

## Grapple

The **target** of a **grapple** must be **no more than one size larger** than you and must be within your reach.

Using **at least one free hand** you make a **grapple check** instead of an attack roll, which is your **Athletics** check contested by the target's **Athletics** or **Acrobatics** check (the target gets to choose).

If you succeed, you subject the target to the **grappled** condition. You can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Note:** Bear in mind that **grapple check** is **not** an **attack roll**, it's an **ability check**. Therefore, special effects that grant you advantage on attacks **do not apply to grappling checks**, but effects that give you advantage on Strength checks **do**.

### Escaping a grapple

A **grappled** creature can use its **action** to attempt an escape. It must then succeed on an **Athletics** or **Acrobatics** check (it gets to choose) contested by the grappler's **Athletics** check.

If **either** the **grappler** or the **grappled target** is subject to **any involuntary movement**, the grapple **ends immediately**.

### Moving a grappled creature

When you move, you can **drag or carry** the grappled creature **with you**. Your **speed** is then **halved**, **unless** the creature is **two or more sizes smaller** than you.

## Shove

The **target** of a **shove** must be **no more than one size larger** than you and must be within your reach.

Instead of an attack roll, you make an **Athletics** check contested by the target's **Athletics** or **Acrobatics** check (the target gets to choose).

If you win the contest, you either knock the target **prone** or **push** the target **5 feet** away from you.

**Hint:** You can **grapple** a creature and then follow up with a **shove**. This makes the target **grappled** and **prone** at the same time. They will be unable to stand up from the prone condition, given how being grappled reduces their movement to 0. Moreover, you will have **advantage** on **all attacks** you make against that creature.
