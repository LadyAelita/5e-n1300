# Attacks

## Making an attack

Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.

1. **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.
2. **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.
3. **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.

If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: *if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack*.

## Attack rolls and modifiers

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.

**Note:** Every **+1** you get to an attack roll represents a **+5%** chance to hit.

### Ability modifiers

Melee attacks use the **Strength** modifier, unless the weapon has the **finesse** property, in which case **Dexterity** is used instead.

Ranged attacks use the **Dexterity** modifier, unless the weapon has the **thrown** property and **does not** have the **finesse** property, in which case **Strength** is used instead.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack is that of the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, which is generally determined by your class.

### Proficiency bonus

If you're attacking either with a **weapon** that you are **proficient** with, with a **spell**, or with an **unarmed strike**, you also add your **proficiency** bonus to the attack roll.

### Advantage and disadvantage

This mechanic works for attack rolls exactly as it does for any other kind of a check that uses a d20.

If you have **advantage** on an attack, you roll **two d20** and take the **higher** result.

If you have **disadvantage** on an attack, you roll **two d20** and take the **lower** result.

### Critical hit or miss

If the d20 die used for an attack roll lands on a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a **critical hit**. Some weapons or abilities might increase the **critical hit range**, meaning there are more numbers on the d20 that represent a critical hit when you roll and get them as the natural result.

If the d20 die used for an attack roll lands on a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is a **critical miss** and it might have additional unforseen consequences, determined by the GM.

**Note:** Your chance to roll a 20 and score a critical hit is nearly **twice as high** when you're attacking with **advantage** (and it's **significantly lower** when attacking with **disadvantage**).

### Touch attacks

Some weapons or spell attacks only need to hit the frame of a creature in order to cause harm, ignoring physical armor. This is called a **touch attack**.

A touch attack requires the result of the attack roll to only exceed the target's Touch Armor Class, which is generally lower than the regular Armor Class.

**Hint:** Touch attacks are effective against heavily armored opponents. However, they aren't much more accurate than regular attacks, when targeting a lightly-armored, dexterous foe.

## Damage rolls

Once you hit, you roll to determine the damage dealt. The number and type of dice you roll for that purpose is determined by the weapon or the spell you've hit with. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

When you roll for damage dealt with a **weapon** attack (or an unarmed attack), you add your **ability modifier** - the same ability modifier that you used for the attack roll. You do not do that for **spells**, unless it's explicitly noted in the spell's description.

You **do not add your proficiency** bonus to **damage** rolls.

If a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one target at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.

## Melee attacks

You can make melee attacks against creatures within your **reach**. **Reach** for most weapons and creatures is typically **5 feet**, which means one can attack creatures adjacent to them. Some weapons are longer than others and have a greater reach, such as **10 feet**, and some monsters might have attacks with a longer reach thanks to their size or unusual anatomy.

### Unarmed attacks

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to **1 + your Strength modifier**. You always count as **proficient** with your unarmed strikes.

### Opportunity attacks

You can spend your **reaction** to make an opportunity attack against a creature that moves **out of your reach**. Note how this also includes a creature moving **through your reach**, for example, by trying to run past you to get to your backline.

Moreover, when one creature enters the reach of another combatant, and the combatant's reach is greater than the creature's, the entering creature provokes an opportunity attack from the combatant.

**Note:** "Entering the reach" only constitutes for the instant the border of the reach radius is being crossed, not for movement within that reach.

Creatures that are lying prone and are trying to stand up, also provoke opportunity attacks. If you hit such a creature with an opportunity attack and beat their AC by more than 5, they get knocked right back down.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack for the rest of your turn by taking the **Disengage** action. You also **don't provoke** an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.

**Warning:** Bear in mind, that there might exist creatures which are **immune** to opportunity attacks.

If a creature **is hit** with an **opportunity attack**, it **cannot attack** anybody **other than the attacker** until the start of its next turn.

### Dual wielding

You can dual wield two one-handed weapons as long as they have the **light** property. When you take the **Attack action** to attack with one of those wepaons, you can also use your **bonus action** to attack once with the other one. You **don't add your ability modifier** to the **damage** of that **additional attack**, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, making a **ranged** attack with it instead of a melee one.

## Ranged attacks

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.

Many ranged attacks have two ranges. The **smaller** number is the **normal range**, and the **larger** number is the **long range**. Your attack roll has **disadvantage** when your target is **beyond normal** range but **within long range**, and you **can't attack** a target **beyond the long range**.

### Shooting into melee

A creature (regardless if it's friend or foe) standing on the straight line between the shooter and the target provides the target with **half-cover**, giving it +2 to AC (both regular and touch) and Dexterity saves.

**Hint:** While behind cover, such as a column, you can spend some of your movement to get out of the cover, make a ranged attack, and then use the rest of your movement to get back behind cover. This all takes place within **your** turn, meaning the opposition can't respond by attacking you in that short window when you weren't being protected by your cover.

### Ranged attacks in close combat

When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have **disadvantage** on the attack roll if you are **within 5 feet of any hostile creature** who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.

### Artillery attacks

Certain special types of weapons, such as **cannons** or **grenades**, are so unwieldy and/or unstable, that attacks made with them are largely imprecise and can hit completely off-target.

If such an attack **misses** and the result of the attack roll, regardless of whether it's a regular or touch attack, would miss the target's Touch AC, the attack hits **off-target**. In such case, roll a d4 and a d8. The d8 determines a **direction**, and the d4 determines **how many tiles away** from the target did the attack land.

Artillery attacks do not go off target if the target is **Huge** or **Gargantuan**.

## Targeting a tile

Many **grenades** explode when they hit a target, creating a Fireball-esque effect that is dependant on the creatures within a radius failing their saving throws. With such weapons, it might be easier to hit an **empty tile** nearby, instead of a specific creature. For these purposes, a tile is considered to have a **Touch AC** of **10**.

Shooting a projectile with a regular ranged weapon into a 5-foot tile, however obscure the potential purpose might be, is much easier. In such case, it's enough to beat an **AC** of **5**.

## Invisible targets

You can attack a target you can't see by guessing their position. In that case, you select a tile where you expect the target to be and make an attack with **disadvantage**. If the creature is not even on that tile, you automatically miss. However, typically you will not know whether the miss was caused by you guessing the wrong tile, or your roll not being good enough.

## Attacking objects

Inanimate objects, such as a table, a cart, or a castle wall, are treated just like creatures, with the following exceptions:

### Object sections

**Huge** and **Gargantuan** objects are divided into **sections**, each of which is treated as a separate **Large** object. In some cases, destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 Hit Points.

### Damage Threshold

Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a **Damage Threshold**.

An object with a Damage Threshold takes **no damage** from an attack or effect, **unless** the damage is **equal to or greater than its Damage Threshold**, in which case it takes that damage as normal.

## Underwater combat

When making a **melee weapon attack** underwater, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has **disadvantage** on the attack roll **unless** the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** made underwater **automatically misses** a target **beyond** the weapon's **normal range**. Even against a target **within normal range**, the attack roll has **disadvantage**, **unless** the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are **fully immersed in water** have **resistance to fire** damage.
