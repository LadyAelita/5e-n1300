[gimmick:title](Death)

# Death

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious.

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. 

## Overkill

Massive damage can kill you **instantly**. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the **remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum**.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

**Warning:** You can get **one-shot instantly** from **full health** if you take damage **equal to twice your health maximum**.

## Cinematic death

The GM might just **announce** that your character **dies** as a result of something taking place outside of regular combat rules. For example, if you voluntarily jump into an active volcano, it's very likely that you're going to die without any saving throws or damage rolls.

## Going down

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points without instantly killing you, you go into one of three unconscious states, each more severe than the previous one. The three states are **unconscious**, **battered** and **dying**. If you're in any of those states, you're considered to be "**down**".

If you get reduced to 0 hit points by either an attack thrown with the **intent to only knock you out** without killing you, or a **non-magical unarmed strike** that deals **bludgeoning** damage, you become **unconscious**.

If you get reduced to 0 hit points by a **non-magical weapon** attack that deals **physical** (slashing, piercing or bludgeoning) damage, or a **non-magical unarmed attack** that deals **slashing** or **piercing** damage (such as a claw or bite attack), and the attack **was not a critical hit** you become **battered**.

If you get reduced to 0 hit points by an attack that doesn't make you unconscious or battered, you become **dying**.

**Note:** You're considered "**stable**" if you're neither **battered** nor **dying**, given how both of those states have the character make **death saving throws** in regular intervals. Being stable/unstable is not a mechanic, just a way to denote that a character is at a risk of passing away if no action is taken to prevent that.

## Getting worse

Whenever an **unconscious** creature takes damage, it becomes **battered**, if the damage was from a **non-magical weapon** attack that deals **physical** (slashing, piercing or bludgeoning) damage, or a **non-magical unarmed attack** that deals **slashing** or **piercing** damage (such as a claw or bite attack), and the attack **was not a critical hit**. Otherwise, it becomes **dying**.

Whenever a **battered** creature takes damage, it becomes **dying**.

Whenever a **dying** creature takes damage, it makes a **death saving throw**.

## Death saving throws

A **death saving throw** is a **Constitution** saving throw against the **DC** of **10**. Every time you **fail** a death saving throw, you mark it on your character sheet. Once you accumulate **three failures**, you **die**.

When you make a death saving throw and roll a **natural 1**, it counts as **two failures**. If you roll a natural 20, and have marked failures, you **remove one failure**. If you don't have any failures, you **regain 1 hit point**, which stabilizes you.

Every time you **succeed** on a death saving throw, mark a success on your sheet. If you manage to accumulate **three successes** before you get three failures, **you regain 1 hit point**, which stabilizes you. Once this happens, you stop marking successes until you finish a long rest - you **cannot** self-stabilize this way again. You still regain 1 hit point if you roll a natural 20 and have no failures, though.

You make a death saving throw at the start of **every 10 minutes** if you're **battered**, or at the start of **each turn** if you're **dying**. You can get advantage on these death saving throws if someone successfully provides you with **makeshift first aid** (without a healing kit).

**Dying** creatures also make a **death saving throw** whenever they **take damage**.

You erase all accumulated death saving throw failures once you become conscious again.

## Saving dying creatures

**Healing** is the most reliable and effective way to get a dying creature back up. If a creature that's **dying** or **battered** regains a positive number of hit points, it becomes only **unconscious**, keeping the hit points regained as a result of the heal. If an **unconscious** creature regains a positive number of hit points, it becomes conscious again.

Alternatively, you can provide **first aid** to a **dying** or **battered** creature using a **healer's kit**. In such case, you make a Medicine or a Survival check **with advantage** against the DC of 10. A success improves the creature's state by **one degree**, meaning it goes from **dying** to **battered**, or from **battered** to **unconscious**. The creature also makes the death saving throws with **advantage**.

A **healer's kit** can be used to improve a creature's state only **once** - you **can't** use it **twice in a row** on a dying creature to get it back to unconscious. This condition resets on a creature once it becomes conscious again.

If you don't have a healer's kit, you can attempt **makeshift first aid**. You make the same Medicine/Survival check against DC of 10, but **without advantage**. If you succeed, the target creature's state doesn't get better, but it still gets advantage on **death saving throws**.

## Regaining consciousness

When a creature **stops being unconscious**, it is still **stunned** until it spends its **entire turn** to compose itself by making a Composure check against DC 10. Such attempts can be repeated until success.

## Coup de Grâce

If a creature **within 5 feet of you** is **helpless** (which it is if it's **down**), you can take a **full round action** to execute a single weapon attack (melee or ranged) in an attempt to finish it off. This is called Coup de Grâce.

Coup de Grâce **provokes opportunity attacks**. If you get hit with an opportunity attack provoked by your attempt at a Coup de Grâce, the Coup de Grâce is **interrupted** and **has no effect**.

If nobody interrupts your Coup de Grâce, you make an attack roll against the target, **without any advantages** that come with the target being helpless. If you **hit**, the target **dies**. If you **miss**, you "only" **hit the target critically** and deal appropriate damage.

Coup de Grâce can only be attempted using the following weapons:

* any martial weapon, save for lance, whip, blowgun and net,
* dagger,
* handaxe,
* sickle,
* spear,
* light crossbow.

**Warning:** If you're using an **exotic** weapon, it's best to ask your GM if it can be used to perform a Coup de Grâce. Or simply carry a spare dagger on you at all times. Also, bear in mind that any weapon can be used to finish somebody off given enough time (through attacking them, thus triggering a death save on each attack), it's just that Coup de Grâce lets you do this within a single turn.
