[gimmick:title](Death)

# Death

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious.

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious.

Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters. 

## Overkill

Massive damage can kill you **instantly**. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the **remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum**.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

**Warning:** You can get **one-shot instantly** from **full health** if you take damage **equal to twice your health maximum**.

## Cinematic death

The GM might just **announce** that your character **dies** as a result of something taking place outside of regular combat rules. For example, if you voluntarily jump into an active volcano, it's very likely that you're going to die without any saving throws or damage rolls.

## Going down

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points without instantly killing you, you go into one of two states - **unconscious** or **dying**. If you're in any of those states, you're considered to be "**down**".

If you get reduced to 0 hit points by either an attack thrown with the **intent to only knock you out** without killing you, or a **non-magical unarmed strike** that deals **bludgeoning** damage, you become **unconscious**. Otherwise, you become **dying**.

You're considered "**stable**" if you're **unconscious**, but **not dying**.

## Getting worse

Whenever an **unconscious** creature takes damage, it becomes **dying**.

Whenever a **dying** creature takes damage, it makes a **death saving throw**.

## Death saving throws

A **death saving throw** is a **special** saving throw against the **DC** of **10**. Death saving throws are **modified** by your **Constitution modifier**, but **do not count as Constitution saving throws**. Every time you **fail** a death saving throw, you mark a failure on your character sheet. Likewise, every time you **succeed** a death saving throw, you mark a success. 

Once you accumulate **five failures**, you **die**. Once you accumulate **five successes**, you **become stable**, becoming merely **unconscious** instead of dying.

When you make a death saving throw and roll a **natural 1**, it counts as **two failures**. If you roll a **natural 20**, it counts as **two successes**, and if you don't have any death saving throw failures at the moment of rolling the natural 20, you immediately **regain 1 hit point** and become **conscious** again.

You make a death saving throw immediately whenever you go into the **dying** state, and then at the start of **each of your turns** for as long as you're **dying**. You can get **advantage** on these death saving throws if someone successfully provides you with **makeshift first aid** (without a healing kit).

**Dying** creatures also make a **death saving throw** whenever they **take damage**.

You **erase** all accumulated death saving throw failures and successes once you leave the **dying** state.

**Warning:** Bear in mind, that you do **not** include Constitution saving throw proficiency for death saving throws.

## Saving dying creatures

**Healing** is the most reliable and effective way to get a dying creature back up. If a creature that's **dying** regains a positive number of hit points, it becomes only **unconscious**, keeping the hit points regained as a result of the heal. If the heal is greater than or equal to **10 + the dying creature's level**, the creature becomes conscious instead.

If an **unconscious** creature regains a positive number of hit points, it becomes conscious again.

Alternatively, you can provide **first aid** to a **dying** creature using a **healer's kit**. In such case, you make a Medicine or a Survival check **with advantage** against the DC of 10. A success stabilizes the creature.

If you don't have a healer's kit, you can attempt **makeshift first aid**. You make the same Medicine/Survival check against DC of 10, but **without advantage**. If you succeed, the target creature's state doesn't get better, but it gets advantage on **death saving throws**.

An unconscious creature also **automatically regains consciousness** after **1d8 hours**.

Finally, during battle, an unconscious creature can roll a d20 on each of its turn, immediately becoming conscious again if the result is a natural 20.

## Regaining consciousness

When a creature **stops being unconscious**, it's initially **incapacitated** and **dazed**. On its first turn since regaining consciousness, the creature makes a **DC 10** **Constitution saving throw** to try and compose itself. On a success, it can act normally. On a failure, it **remains** **incapacitated** and **dazed** until the start of its next turn.

## Coup de Grâce

If a creature **within 5 feet of you** is **helpless** (which it is if it's **down**), you can take a **full round action** to execute a single weapon attack (melee or ranged) in an attempt to finish it off. This is called Coup de Grâce.

Coup de Grâce **provokes opportunity attacks**. If you get hit with an opportunity attack provoked by your attempt at a Coup de Grâce, the Coup de Grâce is **interrupted** and **has no effect**.

If nobody interrupts your Coup de Grâce, you make an attack roll against the target, **without any advantages** that come with the target being helpless. If you **hit**, the target **dies**. If you **miss**, you "only" **hit the target critically** and deal appropriate damage.

Coup de Grâce can only be attempted using any weapon in which you're proficient (it can also be an unarmed attack).
