# Druid

Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, **druids** are an embodiment of nature's resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature, but see themselves as extensions of nature's indomitable will, serving the spirits of the land.

Once you gain a circle spell, you **always** have it **prepared** and it **doesn't count** against the number of spells you can prepare each day. |

## Wild Shape (1st level)

**Twice between rests**, you can use your **action** to magically **assume the shape of a beast** that you have seen before or have detailed knowledge of. The beast must not have a CR higher than the limit shown in the Druid table.

You can **stay** in a **beast shape** for a **number of hours** equal to **half your Druid level** (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form, unless you immediately expend another use of this feature. You can also voluntarily revert to your normal form as a **bonus action**. Moreover, you automatically revert if you fall **unconscious** or **drop to 0** hit points.

While you're transformed, the following rules apply:

* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you **retain** your **alignment**, **personality**, and **Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma** scores. You also **retain** all of your **skill** and **saving throw** **proficiencies**, in addition to **gaining those of the creature.** If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any **legendary** or **lair actions**, you **can't use them**.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's **hit points** and **Hit Dice**. When you **revert** to your normal form, you return to the **number of hit points you had before you transformed**. However, if you **revert** as a result of **dropping to 0** hit points, any **excess damage carries over** to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you don't go down.
* You **can't cast spells**, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming **doesn't break your concentration** on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've **already cast**.
* You **retain** the benefit of any **features** from your **class**, **race**, or **other source** and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you **can't use** any of your **normal form's special senses**, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
* You **choose** whether your **equipment** falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your **equipment doesn't change size or shape** to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. **Equipment that merges** with the form **has no effect** until you leave the form.

## Beast Spells (18th level)

You can **cast** many of your **Druid spells** in any shape you assume **using Wild Shape**. You can perform the **somatic** and **verbal** components of a Druid spell while in a beast shape, but you **aren't able to provide material or focus components**.

## Timeless Body (18th level)

*The primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.*

For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.

## Archdruid (20th level)

You can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

# Druid Circles

## List of Druid Circles

* **Circle of the Land:** The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the old faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.
* **Circle of the Moon:** Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid. Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The wild is in the druid's blood.
* **Circle of the Shepherd:** Druids of the Circle of the Shepherd commune with the spirits of nature, especially the spirits of beasts and the fey, and call to those spirits for aid. These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey.
* **Circle of Spores:** Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are portions of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death is not the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

### Natural Recovery (2nd level)

*You can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature.*

**Once a day**, during a **short rest**, you choose expended **spell slots** to **recover**. The spell slots can have a **combined order** that is **equal to or less** than **half your Druid level** (rounded up), and **none** of the slots can be **6th order or higher**.

### Land's Stride (6th level)

You **ignore nonmagical difficult terrain**. You can also **pass through nonmagical plants** without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have **advantage** on **saving throws** against **plants** that are **magically** created or manipulated to **impede movement**, such as those created by the Entangle spell.

When a **beast** or **plant** creature **attacks you**, that creature must make a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Druid spell save DC**. On a **failed** save, the creature must **choose a different target**, or the attack automatically **misses**. On a **successful** save, the creature is **immune** to this effect for **24 hours**.

The creature is **aware of this** effect **before** it makes its attack against you.

## Druid Circle: Moon

### Combat Wild Shape (2nd level)

You gain the ability to use **Wild Shape** as a **bonus action**, rather than as an **action**.

Additionally, **while** you are **transformed** by Wild Shape, you can **use a bonus action** to **expend one spell slot** to **regain 1d8 hit points per spell slot level**.

### Circle Forms (2nd level)

*The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous animal forms.*

You consult the table below instead of the Druid table when estimating the maximal CR of a beast you can transform into using Wild Shape.

| Druid Level | Wild Shape Max. CR |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| **1**       | 1/4                |
| **2-5**     | 1                  |
| **6-8**     | 2                  |
| **9-11**    | 3                  |
| **12-14**   | 4                  |
| **15-17**   | 5                  |
| **18-20**   | 6                  |

### Primal Strike (6th level)

You can cast the **Alter Self** spell **at will**.

---

## Druid Circle: Shepherd

### Speech of the Woods (2nd level)

*You gain the ability to converse with beasts and many fey.*

**Beasts** can **understand your speech**, and **you** gain the ability to **decipher their noises and motions**. Most beasts lack the intelligence to convey or understand sophisticated concepts, but a friendly beast could relay what it has seen or heard in the recent past. This ability doesn’t grant you any special friendship with beasts, though you can combine this ability with gifts to curry favor with them as you would with any nonplayer character.

### Spirit Totem (2nd level)

*You gain the ability to call forth nature spirits and use them to influence the world around you.*

**Once between rests**, as a **bonus action**, you can magically **summon an incorporeal spirit** to a point you can see **within 60 feet** of you. The spirit creates an **aura** in a **30-foot radius around that point**. It counts as neither a creature nor an object, though it has the spectral appearance of the creature it represents. As a **bonus action**, you can **move the spirit up to 60 feet** to a point you can see. The spirit persists for **1 minute**.

The effect of the spirit’s aura depends on the type of spirit you summon from the options below.

* **Bear Spirit:** *The bear spirit grants you and your allies its might and endurance.* Each creature of your choice **in the aura when the spirit appears** gains **temporary hit points** equal to **5 + your Druid level**. In addition, you and your allies gain **advantage** on **Strength checks and saving throws** while **in the aura**.
* **Hawk Spirit:** *The hawk spirit is a consummate hunter, aiding you and your allies with its keen sight.* When a creature **makes an attack** roll **against a target in the spirit’s aura**, you can use your **reaction** to grant **advantage** to that attack roll. In addition, you and your allies have **advantage** on **Perception** checks **while in the aura**.
* **Unicorn Spirit:** *The unicorn spirit lends its protection to those nearby.* You and your allies gain **advantage** on all **ability checks made to detect** creatures **in the spirit’s aura**. In addition, if you **cast a spell** using a spell slot that **restores hit points** to a creature, **regardless** of whether the creature is inside or outside the aura, **each creature** of your choice **in the aura** also **regains hit points** equal to **your Druid level**.

### Guardian Spirit (10th level)

*Your Spirit Totem safeguards the beasts and fey that you call forth with your magic.*

When a **beast** or **fey** that you **summoned or created** with a spell **ends its turn in your Spirit Totem aura**, that creature **regains** a number of **hit points** equal to **half your Druid level**.

### Faithful Summons (14th level)

*The nature spirits you commune with protect you when you are the most defenseless.*

**Once per day**, if you are **reduced to 0** hit points or **are incapacitated** against your will, you can **immediately** gain the benefits of **Summon Animals** as if it were cast with a **9th-level** spell slot. It summons **four beasts** of your choice that are **challenge rating 2** or lower. The conjured beasts appear **within 20 feet** of you. If they receive no commands from you, they **protect you from harm** and **attack your foes**.

*You are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby.*

When a **creature** you can see **moves** into a space **within 10 feet of you** or **starts its turn there**, you can use your **reaction** to deal **necrotic damage** to that creature, as shown in the table below, unless it succeeds on a **Constitution saving throw** against your **spell save DC**.

| Druid Level | Halo of Spores damage |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| **2-5**     | 1d4                   |
| **6-9**     | 1d6                   |
| **10-13**   | 1d8                   |
| **14-20**   | 1d10                  |

### Symbiotic Entity (2nd level)

*You gain the ability to channel magic into your spores.*

As an **action**, you can **expend** a use of your **Wild Shape** feature to awaken your spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you **gain temporary hit points** equal to **5 times your Druid level**. While **this feature is active**, you also gain the following benefits:

* When you **deal** your **Halo of Spores damage**, **roll the damage die a second time and add it** to the total.
* Your **melee weapon attacks** deal an **extra 1d6 poison damage** to any target they hit.

These benefits last for **10 minutes**, until you **lose the temporary hit points**, or until you use your **Wild Shape again**.

### Fungal Infestation (6th level)

*Your spores gain the ability to infest a humanoid corpse and animate it.*

If a **beast** or **humanoid** that is Small or Medium **dies within 10 feet** of you, you can use your **reaction** to **animate** it, causing it to **stand up immediately** with **1 hit point**. The creature uses the **zombie** statistics. It remains animate for **1 hour**, after which time it collapses and dies.

In combat, the zombie's turn is immediately after yours. It obeys your mental commands, and the **only action** it can take is the **Attack** action, making **one melee attack**.

### Spreading Spores (10th level)

*You gain the ability to seed an area with deadly spores.*

As a **bonus action** while your **Symbiotic Entity feature is active**, you can **hurl spores up to 30 feet** away, where they swirl in a **10-foot cube** for **1 minute**. The spores **disappear** early if you **use this feature again**, if you **dismiss** them as a **bonus action**, or if your **Symbiotic Entity** feature **is no longer active**.

Whenever a **creature moves into** the cube or **starts its turn** there, that creature **takes your Halo of Spores damage**, unless the creature succeeds on a **Constitution saving throw** against **your spell save DC**. A creature can take this damage **no more than once** per turn.

While the **cube of spores persists**, you **can't use your Halo of Spores** as a **reaction**.

### Fungal Body (14th level)

*The fungal spores in your body alter you.*

You **can’t be blinded**, **deafened**, **frightened**, or **poisoned**. Moreover, you're **immune to critical hits**, **unless** you're **incapacitated**.
