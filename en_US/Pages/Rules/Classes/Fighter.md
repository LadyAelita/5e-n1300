# Fighter

**Fighters** learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

# Martial Archetypes

## List of Martial Archetypes

* **Banneret:** A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of one in a hamlet is enough to cause some bandits to seek easier prey. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.
* **Battle Master:** You excel at controlling the battlefield and specialize in combat maneuvers that distract, goad, and manipulate your enemies with deadly precision, giving you a trick for nearly every situation.
* **Brute:** You are a simple warrior who relies on mighty attacks and your own durability to overcome their enemies. You may combine this physical might with tactical cunning, or just hit things until those things stop hitting back.
* **Cavalier:** You specialize in mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a Cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. As a Cavalier, you have also learnt how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as a protector of your superiors and of the weak.
* **Champion:** You focus on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection, combining rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.
* **Determinator:** The Determinator is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. They are as scrappy as they come, their resolve nearly unbreakable.
* **Eldritch Knight:** The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.
* **Monster Hunter:** You are an expert at defeating supernatural threats. You have learnt how to overcome a variety of unnatural defenses and attacks, including those of undead, lycanthropes, and other creatures of horror.
* **Scout:** The archetypal scout excels at finding safe passage through dangerous regions. Scouts usually favor light armor and ranged weapons, but they are comfortable using heavier gear when faced with intense fighting.
* **Sharpshooter:** You are a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, youâ€™re a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

### Inspiring Surge (10th, 18th level)

### Bulwark (15th level)

### Battle Master Maneuvers

#### Commander's Strike

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Disarming Attack

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.

#### Distracting Strike

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

#### Evasive Footwork

When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.

#### Feinting Attack

You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your turn. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Goading Attack

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.

#### Lunging Attack

When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach for that attack by 5 feet. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Maneuvering Attack

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.

#### Menacing Attack

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

#### Parry

When another creature damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to reduce the damage by the number you roll on your superiority die + your Dexterity modifier.

#### Precision Attack

When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature, you can expend one superiority die to add it to the roll. You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

#### Power Attack

When you make a weapon attack that uses Strength modifier, if it's your first attack on this turn, you can expend any number of superiority dice. If the attack hits, you add all the expended superiority dice to the attack's damage roll. Regardless of whether you hit or miss, you then can't make any attacks for the remainder of your turn (you can still make opportunity attacks). You can use this maneuver before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

#### Pushing Attack

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Rally

On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.

#### Riposte

When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Sweeping Attack

When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Trip Attack

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.

These temporary hit points last until **the next** short or long **rest**, or **the next but one time you roll initiative**, whichever happens sooner (as in, you have them for the next fight that takes place after using this ability, but not for any fights that happen after that).

While you have 0 hit points during that extra turn, you can still possibly die due to failed death saving throws. When the **extra turn ends**, if you **still have 0 hit points**, you **go down**.
