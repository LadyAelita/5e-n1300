# Bard

Whether scholar, skald, or scoundrel, a **bard** weaves their innate magic, quite often of an unknown origin, through words and music to inspire allies, demoralize foes, manipulate minds, create illusions, and even heal wounds. The bard is a master of song, speech, and the magic they contain.

## Bardic Inspiration (1st, 5th, 10th, 15th level)

*You can inspire others through stirring words or music.* 

A number of times equal to your **Charisma modifier per day**, you can use a **bonus action** to choose **one** creature **other than yourself** within **60 feet** of you who **can hear you**. That creature **gains one Bardic Inspiration die**, a d6.

**Once** within the **next 10 minutes**, the creature can **roll** the die and **add the number** rolled to **one check it makes**. The creature can wait until **after** it **rolls the d20** before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide **before** the DM says whether the **roll succeeds or fails**. 

Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only **one** Bardic Inspiration die **at a time**.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class, as per the Bard table.

## Jack of All Trades (2nd level)

You add **half your proficiency** bonus, **rounded down**, to **any skill check** you make with a skill you **don't** have proficiency or expertise in.

## Song of Rest (2nd, 9th, 13th, 17th level)

*You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.*

If you or **any friendly creatures** who **can hear** your performance **spend** one or more **Hit Dice** to regain hit points at the end of the **short rest**, **each** of those creatures **regains an extra 1d6 hit points**.

The amount of additional regained hit points changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a **d8** at **9th level**, a **d10** at **13th level**, and a **d12** at **17th level**.

As an **action**, you can **start a performance** that lasts until the **end of your next turn**. During that time, **you** and **any friendly creatures within 30 feet** of you have **advantage** on **saving throws** against **fear** and **charm**. A creature must be **able to hear you** to gain this benefit. 

The performance **ends** early if you are **incapacitated** or **silenced** or if you **voluntarily end it** (no action required).

# Bard Colleges

## List of Bard Colleges

* **College of Blood:** The battlefield is your canvas, your sword is your paintbrush, and the blood - your paint. You color the battlefield with the vital juices of your foes, and the more crimson the scene gets, the more focused you become. Those fortunate enough to survive until the grand finale of your masterpiece are simultanously unfortunate enough to have endured tremendous pain. Alas, all for naught, as their legacy is that of mere background actors, who bled to their demise in the ominous shadow cast by you - the author of the play.
* **College of Glamour:** The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.
* **College of Lore:** Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king. The loyalty of these bards usually lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.
* **College of Satire:** Satirists use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king’s royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand’s affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin's innocence, a satirist never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh. They are generally loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist’s treachery or exposing a baron’s plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.
* **College of Swords:** Bards of the College of Swords entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. They perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right. Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Others strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a blade’s talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust one of them in their ranks.
* **College of Valor:** Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
* **College of Whispers:** Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.

## Bard College: Blood

### Bonus Proficiencies

You get **proficiency** in **Intimidation**, **rapiers**, **scimitars** and **shortswords**.

You can use a **finesse melee weapon** you're **proficient** in, that deals **slashing** or **piercing** damage, as your **spellcasting focus**.

### Color the Battlefield (3rd level)

When you deal **slashing** or **piercing** damage with a **finesse melee weapon** you're proficient with, you can **expend** a **Bardic Inspiration** charge, causing the target to bleed heavily from the fresh wound and **dealing additional necrotic damage** equal to **your Bardic Inspiration die**. This has **no effect** on **constructs** or **undead**. You can only use this feature **on the same creature once per turn**. Whenever you do so, you **gain a Sanguine Inspiration point**.

Based on the **current number** of your **Sanguine Inspiration** points, you gain the following benefits (subsequent tiers **stack** with the previous ones):

| Points  | Benefit(s)                                                   |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1**   | **+1** to **AC** and **attack rolls**                        |
| **2-3** | **+1** to **AC** and **attack rolls** (therefore +2 total), **+1 critical strike range** on **finesse melee weapon attacks** |
| **4**   | All non-friendly creatures **within 30 feet** of you **that can see you** are **fearful of you** |
| **5**   | You have a number of **temporary hit points** equal to **twice your level** |

**All** of your **Sanguine Inspiration** points **expire within a minute** of you having **acquired your most recent** Sanguine Inspiration point.

### Extra Attack (6th level)

You can attack **twice**, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Finale (14th level)

**Once a day**, as an **action**, you can make a devastating **melee weapon attack** against a creature **within reach**. This attack **automatically hits** and **expends all your Sanguine Inspiration charges**. You **roll** a **Bardic Inspiration die for every Sanguine Inspiration spent** and **add the result** to the damage roll of the attack.

If the **target** creature is **under half health**, the attack **strikes critically**. The additional damage **is** multiplied as well.

Afterwards, you can optionally **move** up to your **walking speed without provoking** opportunity attacks. If the attack was critical, you also **regain** up to **d4** of your expended **Bardic Inspiration** charges. However, you also take **one level of exhaustion** and cannot benefit from your **Color the Battlefield** feature until you **finish** a short or long **rest**.

## Bard College: Glamour

### Mantle of Inspiration (3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th level)

*You gain the ability to weave a song of fey magic that imbues your allies with vigor and speed.*

As a **bonus action**, you can **expend one** use of your **Bardic Inspiration** to grant yourself a wondrous appearance. When you do so, choose a **number of creatures you can see** and who **can see you** within **60 feet** of you, up to a number equal to your **Charisma modifier** (minimum of one). Each of them gains **5 temporary hit points**. When a creature gains these temporary hit points, it can **immediately** use its **reaction** to **move up to its speed**, **without provoking** opportunity attacks.

The number of **temporary hit points** increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to **8** at **5th level**, **11** at **10th level**, and **14** at **15th level**.

### Enthralling Performance (3rd level)

*You can charge your performance with seductive fey magic.*

**Once between rests**, if you **perform** for **at least 1 minute**, you can attempt to inspire wonder in your audience by singing, reciting a poem, or dancing. At the **end** of the performance, choose a number of **humanoids within 60 feet** of you who **watched and listened to all of it**, up to a number equal to your **Charisma modifier** (minimum of one). Each target must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **spell save DC** or be **charmed** by you. While charmed in this way, the target idolizes you, it speaks glowingly of you to anyone who speaks to it, and it hinders anyone who opposes you, avoiding violence unless it was already inclined to fight on your behalf. This effect **ends** on a target after **1 hour**, if it **takes any damage**, if **you attack it**, or if it witnesses you **attacking** or **damaging** any of **its allies**.

If a target **succeeds** on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to charm it.

### Mantle of Majesty (6th level)

*You gain the ability to cloak yourself in a fey magic that makes others want to serve you.*

**Once per day**, as a **bonus action**, you cast **Command**, **without expending a spell slot**, and you take on an appearance of unearthly beauty for **1 minute** or **until your concentration ends** (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During this time, you can cast **Command** as a **bonus action** on **each of your turns**, without expending a spell slot.

Any creature **charmed** by you **automatically fails its saving throw** against the Command you cast with this feature.

### Unbreakable Majesty (14th level)

*Your appearance **permanently** gains an otherworldly aspect that makes you look more lovely and fierce.*

In addition, **once between rests**, as a **bonus action**, you can assume a magically majestic presence for **1 minute** or **until** you are **incapacitated**. For the duration, whenever any creature tries to **attack you for the first time on a turn**, the **attacker** must make a **Charisma saving throw** against your **spell save DC**. On a **failed** save, it **can't attack you on this turn**, and it **must choose a new target** for its attack or the attack is **wasted**. On a **successful** save, it **can attack you on this turn**, but it still has **disadvantage** on **any saving throw** it makes **against your spells on your next turn**.

---

## Bard College: Lore

### Bonus Proficiencies

You gain **proficiency** with **any three skills** of your choice.

### Cutting Words (3rd level)

When a creature that **you can see** within **60 feet** of you makes an **attack roll**, an **ability check**, or a **damage roll**, you can use your **reaction** to **expend one** of your uses of **Bardic Inspiration**, **rolling** a Bardic Inspiration die and **subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll**. You can choose to use this feature **after** the creature **makes its roll**, but **before** the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check **succeeds or fails**, or **before** the creature **deals its damage**. The creature is **immune** if it **can't hear you** or if it's **immune** to being **charmed**.

### Additional Magical Secrets (6th level)

If using this ability **grants you a success** on the attack, saving throw, or ability check, **note the number you rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die**. The DM can then **apply that** result as **a penalty** to a check you make, and you **cannot use this** ability again **until you suffer this drawback**. When the DM invokes this penalty, describe an embarrassing gaffe or mistake you make as part of the affected die roll.

**Once between rests**, if you **speak to a humanoid alone** for **at least 1 minute**, you can attempt to seed paranoia and fear into its mind. At the **end** of the conversation, the target must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **spell save DC** or be **frightened** of **you or another creature** of your choice. The target is **frightened** in this way for **1 hour**, **until** it is **attacked** or **damaged**, or until it witnesses **its allies being attacked or damaged**.

If the target **succeeds** on its saving throw, the target has no hint that you tried to frighten it.

### Mantle of Whispers (6th level)

*You gain the ability to adopt a humanoid's persona.*

When a **humanoid dies within 30 feet** of you, you can magically **capture its shadow** using your **reaction**. You **retain this shadow until** you **use it** or you **finish a long rest**.

You can **use the shadow** as an **action**. When you do so, it **vanishes**, magically **transforming into a disguise** that appears on you. You now **look like the dead person**, but healthy and alive. This disguise lasts **for 1 hour** or until you **end** it as a **bonus action**.

### Shadow Lore (14th level)

*You gain the ability to weave dark magic into your words and tap into a creature’s deepest fears.*

**Once per day**, as an **action**, you magically whisper a phrase that **only one creature of your choice** within **30 feet** of you **can hear**. The target must make a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **spell save DC**. It **automatically succeeds** if it **doesn’t share a language** with you or if it **can’t hear** you. On a **successful** saving throw, your whisper sounds like unintelligible mumbling and **has no effect**.

If the target **fails its saving throw**, it is **charmed** by you for the **next 8 hours** or **until** you or your allies **attack** or **damage it**. It interprets the **whispers** as a **description of its most mortifying secret**.

While you **gain no knowledge of this secret**, the target is **convinced you know it**. While **charmed** in this way, the creature **obeys your commands for fear** that you will reveal its secret. It **won’t risk** its **life** for you or **fight** for you, unless it was already inclined to do so. It grants you favors and gifts it would offer to a close friend.

When the **effect ends**, the creature has **no understanding** of why it held you in such fear.
