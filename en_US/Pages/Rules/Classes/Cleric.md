## Channel Divinity (2nd, 6th, 18th level)

*You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects.*

You start with **two** Channel Divinities: **Turn Undead** and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.

**Once between rests**, you can use your Channel Divinity, choosing which effect you wish to create. This requires **no action** unless specified otherwise in the chosen effect's description.

Some Channel Divinity effects require **saving throws**. When you use such an effect from this class, the **DC** equals your Cleric **spell save DC**.

Beginning at **6th level**, you can use your Channel Divinity **twice** between rests, and beginning at **18th level**, you can use it **three times** between rests.

### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an **action**, you **present your holy symbol** and **speak a prayer** censuring the undead. Each **undead** that **can see or hear** you **within 30 feet** of you must make a **Wisdom saving throw**. If the creature **fails** its saving throw, it is **turned for 1 minute** or **until it takes** any **damage**.

A **turned** creature **must** spend its turns trying to **move as far away from you as it can**, and it **can't willingly move** to a space within **30 feet of you**. It also **can't take reactions**. For its **action**, it can use **only** the **Dash** action or **try to escape** from an **effect that prevents it from moving**. If there's **nowhere to move**, the creature can use the **Dodge** action.

## Destroy Undead (5th level)

*You can call on your deity to personally intervene on your behalf when your need is great.*

You can attempt to implore your deity's aid **once per day**, as an **action**. Describe the assistance you seek, and **roll d100**. If you **roll at or under** your **twice your Cleric level, minus 10**, your deity **intervenes**. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any Cleric spell or Cleric domain spell would always be appropriate.

If your deity **intervenes**, you **can't use this feature** again for **7 days**.

## Greater Divine Intervention (20th level)

When using **Divine Intervention**, you can **expend** a **9th-level Cleric spell slot**, in order for your call to **succeed automatically**, no roll required.

# Divine Domains

## List of Divine Domains

* **Arcana Domain:** Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit. The gods of this domain are often associated with knowledge, as learning and arcane power tend to go hand-in-hand. In the World of Northland, deities of this domain include Malcolm, Xeyorth and Yva.
* **Blood Domain:** The Blood domain centers around the understanding of the natural life force within one’s own physical body. The power of blood is the power of sacrifice, the balance of life and death, and the spirit’s anchor within the mortal shell. Clerics of blood seek to tap into the connection between body and soul through divine means, exploit the hidden reserves of will within one’s own vitality, and even manipulate or corrupt the body of others through these secret rites of crimson. Gods of Blood include Belial, as well as demons such as Asmodeus, Jezebeth and The Sovereign.
* **Death Domain:** The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as, to a lesser extent, the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Garthog and The Guardian of Frost are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (U'mar), pain, disease or poison (Khaalt). Demons associated with this domain are Samael, Abaddon, Jezebeth and The Sovereign.
* **Forge Domain:** The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object. Clerics of these deities search for objects lost to the forces of darkness, liberate mines overrun by orcs, and uncover rare and wondrous materials necessary to create potent magic items. Followers of these gods take great pride in their work, and they are willing to craft and use heavy armor and powerful weapons to protect them. Deities of this domain include Kaine, Valerya and The Wanderer.
* **Grave Domain:** Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse’s workings. Deities of the grave include Malcolm, The Guardian of Frost and the demon Samael. These deities teach their followers to respect the dead and pay them due homage. Followers of these deities seek to put restless spirits to rest and ease the suffering of dying creatures. Their magic also allows them to stave off a creature’s death, though they refuse to use such magic to extend a creature’s lifespan beyond its mortal limits.
* **Knowledge Domain:** The gods of knowledge – including Belial, H'zar Lokhan, Malcolm and The Wanderer – value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse. Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can.
* **Life Domain:** The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy – one of the fundamental forces of the universe – that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, most notable examples including Ariel and The Nameless Keeper.
* **Light Domain:** Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power oftheir gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness. Gods of light – including Ariel, The Guardian of Fire, Kaine and The Nameless Keeper – promote the ideals of rebirth and renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun, the moon or the stars in general. Surprisingly, Light is also a domain of the vainglorious demon Naberius.
* **Nature Domain:** Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself, including Khaalt, Valerya and The Wanderer. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods.
* **Obedience Domain:** The Obedience domain represents discipline, as well as general devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. The domain is favored by clerics who use it to benevolently maintain and enforce the law, or simply command obedience in the name of their god or for their own personal gain. Gods who grant access to this domain include Belial, The Guardian of Frost and M'lghorg, as well as the demons Naberius, Verdelet, Jezebeth and The Sovereign.
* **Protection Domain:** The protection domain is the purview of deities who charge their followers to shield the weak from the strong. The gods’ faithful dwell in villages and towns on the borderlands, where they help bolster defenses and seek out evils to defeat. These gods believe that a strong shield and a suit of armor is the best defense against evil, second only to a stout mace on hand to respond to any attacks in kind. Deities who grant this domain include Kaine, The Nameless Keeper and Valerya.
* **Tempest Domain:** Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain – including Shavoy and the demon Leviathan – govern storms, sea, and, sky. Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.
* **Trickery Domain:** Gods of trickery – such as Belial, Dar'Zath, D'horainn, Khaalt, M'lghorg, Nebula, U'mar, Yva and the demoness Jezebeth – are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They're patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, liberators, as well as assassins. Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer stealth, subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than direct confrontation.
* **War Domain:** War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Valerya) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as the demons Asmodeus, Abaddon) and gods of conquest and domination (such as The Guardian of Fire or The Sovereign).
* **Zeal Domain:** Gods governing the Zeal domain – including The Guardian of Fire, Kaine, The Nameless Keeper and demons, such as Asmodeus, Verdelet and The Sovereign – usually possess dominion over fire. They include gods of flame, direct violence, physical strength, and courage. Zeal gods tend to send their clerics as their heralds on the battlefield, to inspire either courage or fear through their potential to cause destruction.

### Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity (2nd level)

*You can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate of yourself.*

For the duration, you **can cast spells** as though you were in the **illusion's** space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when **both** you and your illusion are **within 5 feet** of a **creature that can see the illusion**, you have **advantage** on **attack rolls against that creature**, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

When you reach **14th level**, the **extra damage** increases to **2d8**.

### Improved Duplicity (17th level)

You can create **up to four duplicates** of yourself, instead of one, when you use **Invoke Duplicity**. As a **bonus action**, you can **move any number of them at the same time**.
