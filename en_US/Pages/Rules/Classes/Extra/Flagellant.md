[gimmick:title](Flagellant)

# Flagellant

**Flagellants** seek atonement for vile deeds committed in the past by them or their kindred. Wandering the lands, preaching, healing the meek and fighting the darkness with a fervor that borders on insanity they hope to make amends in the eyes of the people they once hurt and the deity that protects them.

---

## Unarmored Defense (1st level)

*Your constant and ruthless self-flagellation makes your scar-laden flesh less susceptible to pain.*

If you are **not wearing armor** or **using a shield** your **AC** is **10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier**.

## Envoy of Suffering (1st, 6th level)

A **number of times per day** equal to your **Constitution modifier** (minimum of once), as a **reaction** to **an ally** acquiring one of the following conditions: **blinded**, **dazed**, **deafened**, **paralyzed**, **poisoned**, **stunned** or being **affected** by a **disease** or **poison**, you can **take that** acquired condition **on yourself** instead, as long as **you aren't already** suffering from the exact **same condition**.

If **there is a saving throw** related to that effect, **you make it instead** of the target. If you **succeed**, the **condition affects neither** you nor the target. If you **fail**, it **affects only you**. You **automatically fail** the save against **permanent conditions**. 

Starting at **6th level**, you can also **transfer damage** from an ally to yourself using this feature. The transfered damage dealt to you **cannot be reduced** in any way. You then **gain** a number of **Sanguinity Points** equal to **half that damage**.

## Sanguinity (2nd, 5th, 11th, 17th level)

*You constantly repent for your sins by inflicting pain upon yourself. You revel in these extreme emotions and a spark of insane enjoyment lights inside of you.*

As a **bonus action**, you lash at your body, taking **true damage** equal to **your total character level** and **gaining** equally as many **Sanguinity Points**. The **maximal number** of **Sanguinity Points** you can have at the same time is equal to **twice your Flagellant level**. You **lose all** your **Sanguinity Points** when you **regain any hit points**, or after **1 minute** of **not taking any damage**.

If you **have at least 1 Sanguinity Point**, your **melee weapon attacks** deal **extra radiant** **damage** equal to your **Sanguinity Die**. This damage is **added before critical hit multipliers** are applied.

You can also optionally deal necrotic damage instead of radiant - you make the choice during character creation and cannot change it later.

Moreover, you gain **additional benefits** based on the number of Sanguinity Points you have, as shown in the table below. **Subsequent tiers** of benefits **stack** with the previous ones.

| Sanguinity Points | Benefit                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ≥ 1               | **Advantage** on **saving throws** against **charm** and **fear.** |
| ≥ 10              | **+1** base **AC**, **+10 ft** walking **speed.**            |
| ≥ 20              | **Once per turn**, you can make an **additional melee attack** against a **creature you haven't attacked** on this turn yet. |
| ≥ 30              | You roll **twice as much Sanguinity Dice** for the **extra damage** dealt by your **Sanguinity** feature. |

## Sanguine Heal (2nd level)

As a **bonus action**, **spend all Sanguinity Points** and **heal for half of the number** of Sanguinity Points spent in the process.

## Fighting Style (2nd level)

*You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.*

Choose **one** of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a **melee weapon in one hand** and **no other weapons**, you gain a **+2 bonus to damage rolls** with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** Whenever you roll a **1** or **2** on a damage die for an attack you make with a **two-handed weapon** or a **versatile** weapon you're wielding with **two-hands**, you can **reroll the die** and **must use the new** roll.
* **Tunnel Fighter:** As a **bonus action**, you can **enter a defensive stance** until the **start of your next turn**. While **in that stance**, you can make **opportunity attacks** for free, **without** using your **reaction**, and creatures **within your reach** **provoke** opportunity attacks **from you** whenever **they move more than 5 feet**, regardless of whether they leave your reach or not.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting:** While **dual wielding**, whenever you **miss** a **main hand** attack and your **next attack** within the **same turn** is an **offhand** attack, you have **advantage** on **that offhand attack**.

## Bloodletting (3rd level)

**Once per day**, as an **action**, you **end** either **one disease** affecting you, or **one** of the following **conditions** you have: **blinded**, **deafened**, **poisoned**.

## Shared Burden (9th level)

*You can share your burdens with a creature.*

**Once between rests**, when you **hit** a creature with a **melee attack** while **blinded**, **deafened** or **poisoned**, you can try to bestow **all of these** conditions **upon that creature**. The target must beat a **Constitution saving throw** against the **DC** equal to **8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus**, or else all from among these three conditions that are currently affecting you, will also start to affect that creature.

## Abstinence (10th level)

You **no longer need** to **eat** or **drink** to survive.

## Choir of Wounds (13th level)

*You find comfort in the sweet songs of pain your merciless flogging brings you during moments of respite.*

Whenever you **roll a Hit Die** to **regain hit points** during a **short rest**, the result of **each** individual Hit Die roll (after applying modifiers) can **never be lower** than **twice your Constitution modifier** (total minimum of 2).

## Sacrament of the Lash (15th level)

*Your body is completely covered in ritual scars and abrasions and your perseverance is steadfast from the years of punishment you endured.*

You have **advantage** on **Wisdom** and **Charisma saving throws**. Moreover, whenever **your scars are visible** and not hidden, you have **advantage** on **Intimidation checks**.

## Unwavering Fervor (17th level)

*A flagellant does not stray from the path before him towards the light. If the flagellant is indifferent for one moment it will undo a lifetime of penance. This gives the flagellant a vitality that most cannot hope to achieve.*

**Once per day**, when you are **reduced to 0** hit points, you immediately **regain half of your maximum health** (rounded up) and **gain 1** level of **exhaustion**.

## Presbytery of Pain (18th level)

*Your body is a testament of the pain one can take before breaking.*

You gain **resistance** to **non-magical physical damage**.

## Patron Saint (20th level)

*You are considered one of the chosen disciples and hallowed of your deity.*

Your **Constitution** score **increases by 2**, to a maximum of 22. On each **long rest** you **reagain all your Hit Dice** rather than half.

Moreover, you may **ask your deity** for a **Wish**, **once**. That wish cannot be used to achieve means that oppose your deity or your alignment.

# Flagellant Vows

## List of Flagellant Vows

* **Vow of Divinity:** Only in pain can one find enlightement as it brings one closer and closer to the divine as the burden grows. Flagellants making a vow of divinity suffer to understand and ultimately come closer to their chosen deity or patron saint. By lashing and praying they let all foulness be purged from their sacred flesh and as a result they can cast divine spells and heal allies, not unlike a cleric or paladin, even though the aforementioned rarely respect or understand the ways of a flagellant.
* **Vow of Martyrdom:** Flagellants who take a Vow of Martyrdom choose to suffer the wounds of the oppressed, persecuted, diseased and martyred. Every flagellant bears a burden of a lifetime of evil and atone for that life but a flagellant that takes up the Vow of Martyrdom upholds forgiveness as the greatest of virtues. When travelling with other adventurers they protect them by intervening with blind courage. Enduring the wounds and foul enchantments that could otherwise befall their allies.
* **Vow of Retribution:** Enduring the self inflicted penance as a flagellant is a task the meek best avoid. Penance by self-mortification alone is not enough however. A flagellant who takes up the vow of retribution seeks out evil and burns the dark heart out of it. They know what evil, if left unchecked, can do and they will do anything to stop that from happening. They are a maddening storm able to cripple enemies with the same torture that they themselves endure with brutal lashings and punish an enemy that dares to attack them immediately with an almost divine requital.
