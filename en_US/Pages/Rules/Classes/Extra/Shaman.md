| **Cantrips**              | **Yes**, as per the Shaman table.                            |
| **Learning spells**       | You **don't learn spells**. You know **every Shaman spell** of levels for which you have Shaman spell slots. |
| **Preparing spells**      | On a **long rest**, you can **prepare** a number of Shaman spells equal to your **Wisdom modifier + your Shaman level** (minimum of one spell). Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Shaman spell slots.<br />Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br />Preparing a new set of Shaman spells requires takes at least **1 minute per spell level** for **each spell** on your list.<br />Each Shamanistic Tradition has a list of **tradition spells** that you gain at specific Shaman levels provided in the description. Once you gain a tradition spell, you **always** have it **prepared** and it **doesn't count** against the number of spells you can prepare each day. |

## Voodoo Seals (1st level)

A **number of times per day** equal to your **Proficiency bonus**, immediately after you **cast a non-cantrip spell** that **affects other creatures**, you can place a **seal** on **one** of the **spell's targets**, unless the target is an undead or a construct. The **seals** count as a **curse** and can be removed by a **Remove Curse** spell.

Your **seals last until you take a rest**.

When a **sealed creature** **makes any check**, you can **burn one seal** on that creature to impose a **penalty** to that check's result equal to your **Voodoo Seal die**, as shown in the Shaman table. You can wait until **after** the creature **rolls the d20** before deciding to burn the seal, but must decide **before** the DM says whether the **roll succeeds or fails**.

**Each creature** can have **multiple seals** on it at the same time, but you **can only apply one seal per spell cast**.

## Spiritual Aura (3rd level)

When an **incorporeal undead** creature **attacks you**, that creature must make a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Shaman spell save DC**. On a **failed** save, the creature must **choose a different target**, or the attack automatically **misses**. On a **successful** save, the creature is **immune** to this effect for **24 hours**.

## Mark of Mortality (5th level)

**Once per turn**, whenever **you or an ally hit** a creature that **has at least one of your seals** with an **attack**, that creature takes **additional necrotic damage** equal to your **Voodoo Seal die**. This doesn't remove any of the seals from that creature.

## Solicit the Spirits (7th level)

You can attempt to implore the aid of local spirits **once per day**, as an **action**. Describe the assistance you seek, and **roll d20**. If you **roll at or under** **your Shaman level** (at level 20, you don't have to roll anymore), the spirits **intervene**. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; obscure knowledge or an effect of any spell from any class, related to the theme of the region you're in, of the level for which you have spell slots, would always be appropriate.

If the spirits **intervene**, you **can't use this feature** again for **7 days** in that region. The DM determines the borders of those regions.

## Death Cognition (9th level)

You **add your Wisdom modifier** to your **death saving throws**, on top of your **Constitution modifier**.

Moreover, you are **resistant** to **necrotic** and **poison** damage.

## Voodoo Meditation (10th level)

You now also **regain all** your expended **Voodoo Seals** when you complete a **short rest**.

## Voodoo Craze (11th level)

If you take the **Attack action** on your turn against a creature that **has at least one of your seals** on them, you can make **another attack against that target** on the same turn **as a bonus action**.

## Soul Fire Seal (13th level)

**Once between rests**, whenever **you or an ally hit** a creature that **has your seals** with an **attack**, you can **burn all seals it has** on itself. **For each burnt seal**, you **roll** your **Voodoo Seal die 3 times**. That creature takes **necrotic** or **fire** (your choice) **damage equal to the total**.

## Protective Seal (15th level)

As long as you have **Voodoo Seal uses remaining** and you're **not wearing armor you're not proficient with**, you gain **+2 touch AC**.

Moreover, **once per turn** you can **expend a Voodoo Seal** to **add the Voodoo Seal die** to **your saving throw**.

## Tranquil Mind (18th level)

You gain **expertise** in **Wisdom saving throws**.
