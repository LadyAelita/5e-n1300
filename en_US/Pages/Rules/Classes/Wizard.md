# Wizard

**Wizards**, also known as **incantators**, are supreme magic-users with a scientific approach to the art of spellcasting. Drawing on the magical energy within their bodies, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Learning spells**       | You learn spells by **adding them to your spellbook**, as described in the Wizard's Spellbook feature. Moreover, by virtue of gaining Wizard levels, you get to add free spells from the **Wizard/Sorcerer spell list** as per the Wizard table (each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Wizard spell slots). |
| **Preparing spells**      | On a **long rest**, you can **prepare** a number of Wizard spells **from your spellbook** equal to your **Intelligence modifier + your Wizard level** (minimum of one spell). Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Wizard spell slots.<br />Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br />Preparing a new set of Wizard spells requires takes at least **1 minute per spell level** for **each spell** on your list. |

## Wizard's Spellbook (1st level)

### Adding spells

You can **copy** spells from **scrolls** and **other spellbooks**, regardless who wrote them, as long as you know the language used in the source script.

Adding a spell from a foreign source (that is a scroll or a spellbook not written by you) takes **2 hours times the spell's level** (**30 minutes** for **cantrips**). It also requires you to use specially prepared ink. The ink's preparation process **is already included** as part of adding the spell. Your character, however, must be able to prepare the ink.

**Note:** You don't need to add known cantrips to your spellbook, as you can always cast them. However, if it so happens that you come across a written version of a cantrip that is not on the known spell list, you might want to store it for later so that you can learn it - this is done through adding it to the spellbook.

A wizard is **able to prepare gem-based ink** from **basic ink** and **gemdust** related to the spell's element **by default** and they would **never fail** at this trivial task. However, some spells require additional material components, which have to be mixed into the ink as well, regardless if the spell consumes the components or not. This might **seldom** require a **Craftsmanship check**, especially if the **conditions aren't friendly** (for example: traversing the Infernal Plane vs sitting in a proper lab), although the GM might expect that you come up with a creative way to add potentially difficult reagents to the mixture.

The gemdust to ink ratio in the mixture will vary depending on the spell's level, quadratically increasing the value of gemdust required for the process. The values are as follows:

| Spell level | How many gp worth of gemdust |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cantrip     | 5                            |
| 1st         | 10                           |
| 2nd         | 40                           |
| 3rd         | 100                          |
| 4th         | 180                          |
| 5th         | 300                          |
| 6th         | 430                          |
| 7th         | 600                          |
| 8th         | 780                          |
| 9th         | 1000                         |

### Copying from your own spellbook

You can copy spells from your own spellbook, which only takes **30 minutes times spell level** (**10 minutes** for **cantrips**). You still need to expend **the same amount of resources**, though.

## Arcane Recovery (1st level)

*You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.* 

**Once per day** when you **finish a short rest**, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a **combined level** that is **equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up)**, and **none** of the slots can be **6th level or higher**.

## Spell Mastery (18th level)

*You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will.* 

Choose a **1st-level** Wizard spell and a **2nd-level** Wizard spell that are **in your spellbook**. You can cast those spells at their lowest level **without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared**. If you want to cast either spell at a **higher level**, you must **expend a spell slot** as normal.

By spending **8 hours** in study, you can **exchange one or both** of the spells you chose for **different** spells of the same levels.

## Signature Spells (20th level)

*You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.*

Choose **two 3rd-level** Wizard spells **in your spellbook** as your **signature spells**. You **always** have these spells **prepared**, they **don't count against the number** of spells you have **prepared**, and you can cast **each** of them **once between rests** at 3rd level **without expending a spell slot**.

If you want to cast either spell at a **higher level**, you must **expend a spell slot** as normal.

# List of Arcane Traditions

* **Abjuration:** The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation. Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.
* **Bladesinging:** Bladesingers are wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.
* **Conjuration:** As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.
* **Divination:** The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.
* **Enchantment:** You have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.
* **Evocation:** You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.
* **Illusion:** You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.
* **Invention:** The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic – a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse. Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.
* **Lore Mastery:** Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure. Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it.
* **Necromancy:** Spooky skelly-skeletons send shivers down your spine
* **Theurgy:** Deities usually have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.
* **Transmutation:** You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.
* **War Magic:** A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster’s spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses. Evokers sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage's typical response: "*What good is being able to throw a Fireball if I die before I can cast it?*"

## Arcane Tradition: School of Abjuration

### Abjuration Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy an Abjuration spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Arcane Ward (2nd level)

*You can weave magic around yourself for protection.*

**Once a day**, when you cast an Abjuration spell of **1st level or higher**, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts **until you finish a long rest**. The ward has **hit points** equal to **twice your Wizard level + your Intelligence modifier**. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the **ward has 0 hit points**, it **can't absorb** damage, but its magic **remains**. Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell of **1st level or higher**, the ward **regains** a number of **hit points** equal to **twice the level of the spell**.

### Projected Ward (6th level)

When a creature that you can see **within 30 feet** of you **takes damage**, you can use your **reaction** to cause your **Arcane Ward** to **absorb** that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### Improved Abjuration (10th level)

When you cast an Abjuration spell that requires you to make an **ability check** as a part of casting that spell (as in Counterspell and Dispel Magic), you **add your proficiency** bonus to that ability check.

### Spell Resistance (14th level)

You have **advantage** on **saving throws against spells**. Furthermore, you have **resistance** against the **damage of spells**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Bladesinging

### Bonus Proficiencies

You are **proficient** with **light armor** and **one** type of **one-handed melee weapon** of your choice.

You also gain **proficiency** in the **Performance** skill if you don't already have it.

### Bladesong (2nd level)

*You can invoke an elven technique called the Bladesong, which graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.*

**Twice between rests**, provided that you **aren't wearing medium or heavy armor** or **using a shield**, you can use a **bonus action** to start the **Bladesong**, which lasts for **1 minute**. It **ends** early if you are **incapacitated**, if you don **medium or heavy armor or a shield**, or if you **use two hands to make an attack** with a weapon. You can also **dismiss** the Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a **bonus to your AC** equal to your **Intelligence modifier (**minimum of +1).
* Your **walking speed** increases by **10 feet**.
* You have **advantage** on **Acrobatics checks**.
* You gain a **bonus** to **Concentration saving throws**. The bonus equals your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of +1).

### Extra Attack (6th level)

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Song of Defense (10th level)

*You can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active.*

When you **take damage**, you can use your **reaction** to **expend one spell slot** and **reduce that damage** by an amount equal to **5 times the spell slot's level**.

### Song of Victory (14th level)

You add your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of +1) to the **damage** of your **melee weapon attacks** while your **Bladesong is active**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Conjuration

### Conjuration Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy a Conjuration spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Minor Conjuration (2nd level)

You can use your **action** to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see **within 10 feet** of you. This object can be **no larger** than **3 feet on a side** and **weigh no more** than **10 pounds**, and its form must be that of **a nonmagical object that you have seen**. The object is visibly magical, radiating **dim light out to 5 feet**.

The object **disappears after 1 hour**, when you **use this feature again**, or if it **takes any damage**.

### Benign Transportation (6th level)

You can use your **action** to **teleport up to 30 feet** to an unoccupied space that you can see.

Alternatively, you can choose a **space within range** that is **occupied** by a **Small or Medium creature**. If that creature is **willing**, you **both teleport**, **swapping** places.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **long rest** or you **cast a Conjuration spell of 1st level or higher**.

### Improved Abjuration (10th level)

When you cast an Abjuration spell that requires you to make an **ability check** as a part of casting that spell (as in Counterspell and Dispel Magic), you **add your proficiency** bonus to that ability check.

### Spell Resistance (14th level)

You have **advantage** on **saving throws against spells**. Furthermore, you have **resistance** against the **damage of spells**.
