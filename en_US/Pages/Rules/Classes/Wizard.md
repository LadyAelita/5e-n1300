# Wizard

**Wizards**, also known as **incantators**, are supreme magic-users with a scientific approach to the art of spellcasting. Drawing on the magical energy within their bodies, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, brute-force mind control, and much more.

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **Learning spells**       | You learn spells by **adding them to your spellbook**, as described in the Wizard's Spellbook feature. Moreover, by virtue of gaining Wizard levels, you get to add free spells from the **Wizard/Sorcerer spell list** as per the Wizard table (each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Wizard spell slots). |
| **Preparing spells**      | On a **long rest**, you can **prepare** a number of Wizard spells **from your spellbook** equal to your **Intelligence modifier + your Wizard level** (minimum of one spell). Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Wizard spell slots.<br />Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br />Preparing a new set of Wizard spells requires takes at least **1 minute per spell level** for **each spell** on your list. |

## Wizard's Spellbook (1st level)

### Adding spells

You can **copy** spells from **scrolls** and **other spellbooks**, regardless who wrote them, as long as you know the language used in the source script.

Adding a spell from a foreign source (that is a scroll or a spellbook not written by you) takes **2 hours times the spell's level** (**30 minutes** for **cantrips**). It also requires you to use specially prepared ink. The ink's preparation process **is already included** as part of adding the spell. Your character, however, must be able to prepare the ink.

**Note:** You don't need to add known cantrips to your spellbook, as you can always cast them. However, if it so happens that you come across a written version of a cantrip that is not on the known spell list, you might want to store it for later so that you can learn it - this is done through adding it to the spellbook.

A wizard is **able to prepare gem-based ink** from **basic ink** and **gemdust** related to the spell's element **by default** and they would **never fail** at this trivial task. However, some spells require additional material components, which have to be mixed into the ink as well, regardless if the spell consumes the components or not. This might **seldom** require a **Craftsmanship check**, especially if the **conditions aren't friendly** (for example: traversing the Infernal Plane vs sitting in a proper lab), although the GM might expect that you come up with a creative way to add potentially difficult reagents to the mixture.

The gemdust to ink ratio in the mixture will vary depending on the spell's level, quadratically increasing the value of gemdust required for the process. The values are as follows:

| Spell level | How many gp worth of gemdust |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cantrip     | 5                            |
| 1st         | 10                           |
| 2nd         | 40                           |
| 3rd         | 100                          |
| 4th         | 180                          |
| 5th         | 300                          |
| 6th         | 430                          |
| 7th         | 600                          |
| 8th         | 780                          |
| 9th         | 1000                         |

### Copying from your own spellbook

You can copy spells from your own spellbook, which only takes **30 minutes times spell level** (**10 minutes** for **cantrips**). You still need to expend **the same amount of resources**, though.

## Arcane Recovery (1st level)

*You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook.* 

**Once per day** when you **finish a short rest**, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a **combined level** that is **equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up)**, and **none** of the slots can be **6th level or higher**.

## Spell Mastery (18th level)

*You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will.* 

Choose a **1st-level** Wizard spell and a **2nd-level** Wizard spell that are **in your spellbook**. You can cast those spells at their lowest level **without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared**. If you want to cast either spell at a **higher level**, you must **expend a spell slot** as normal.

By spending **8 hours** in study, you can **exchange one or both** of the spells you chose for **different** spells of the same levels.

## Signature Spells (20th level)

*You gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort.*

Choose **two 3rd-level** Wizard spells **in your spellbook** as your **signature spells**. You **always** have these spells **prepared**, they **don't count against the number** of spells you have **prepared**, and you can cast **each** of them **once between rests** at 3rd level **without expending a spell slot**.

If you want to cast either spell at a **higher level**, you must **expend a spell slot** as normal.

# List of Arcane Traditions

* **Abjuration:** The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation. Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.
* **Bladesinging:** Bladesingers are wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.
* **Conjuration:** As a conjurer, you favor spells that produce objects and creatures out of thin air. You can conjure billowing clouds of killing fog or summon creatures from elsewhere to fight on your behalf. As your mastery grows, you learn spells of transportation and can teleport yourself across vast distances, even to other planes of existence, in an instant.
* **Divination:** The counsel of a diviner is sought by royalty and commoners alike, for all seek a clearer understanding of the past, present, and future. As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.
* **Enchantment:** You have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters. Some enchanters are peacemakers who bewitch the violent to lay down their arms and charm the cruel into showing mercy. Others are tyrants who magically bind the unwilling into their service. Most enchanters fall somewhere in between.
* **Evocation:** You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.
* **Illusion:** You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.
* **Invention:** The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic – a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse. Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.
* **Lore Mastery:** Lore Mastery is an arcane tradition fixated on understanding the underlying mechanics of magic. It is the most academic of all arcane traditions. The promise of uncovering new knowledge or proving (or discrediting) a theory of magic is usually required to rouse its practitioners from their laboratories, academies, and archives to pursue a life of adventure. Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it.
* **Necromancy:** Spooky skelly-skeletons send shivers down your spine
* **Theurgy:** Deities usually have clerics, but many gods of magic bid their followers to take up the study of wizardry. These religious magic-users follow the arcane tradition of Theurgy, and are commonly known as theurgists. Such spellcasters are as dedicated and scholarly as any other wizard, but they blend their arcane study with religious devotion.
* **Transmutation:** You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.
* **War Magic:** A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a caster’s spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses. Evokers sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense. A war mage's typical response: "*What good is being able to throw a Fireball if I die before I can cast it?*"

## Arcane Tradition: School of Abjuration

### Abjuration Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy an Abjuration spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Arcane Ward (2nd level)

*You can weave magic around yourself for protection.*

**Once a day**, when you cast an Abjuration spell of **1st level or higher**, you can simultaneously use a strand of the spell's magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts **until you finish a long rest**. The ward has **hit points** equal to **twice your Wizard level + your Intelligence modifier**. Whenever you take damage, the ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, you take any remaining damage.

While the **ward has 0 hit points**, it **can't absorb** damage, but its magic **remains**. Whenever you cast an Abjuration spell of **1st level or higher**, the ward **regains** a number of **hit points** equal to **twice the level of the spell**.

### Projected Ward (6th level)

When a creature that you can see **within 30 feet** of you **takes damage**, you can use your **reaction** to cause your **Arcane Ward** to **absorb** that damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature takes any remaining damage.

### Improved Abjuration (10th level)

When you cast an Abjuration spell that requires you to make an **ability check** as a part of casting that spell (as in Counterspell and Dispel Magic), you **add your proficiency** bonus to that ability check.

### Spell Resistance (14th level)

You have **advantage** on **saving throws against spells**. Furthermore, you have **resistance** against the **damage of spells**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Bladesinging

### Bonus Proficiencies

You are **proficient** with **light armor** and **one** type of **one-handed melee weapon** of your choice.

You also gain **proficiency** in the **Performance** skill if you don't already have it.

### Bladesong (2nd level)

*You can invoke an elven technique called the Bladesong, which graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.*

**Twice between rests**, provided that you **aren't wearing medium or heavy armor** or **using a shield**, you can use a **bonus action** to start the **Bladesong**, which lasts for **1 minute**. It **ends** early if you are **incapacitated**, if you don **medium or heavy armor or a shield**, or if you **use two hands to make an attack** with a weapon. You can also **dismiss** the Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:

* You gain a **bonus to your AC** equal to your **Intelligence modifier (**minimum of +1).
* Your **walking speed** increases by **10 feet**.
* You have **advantage** on **Acrobatics checks**.
* You gain a **bonus** to **Concentration saving throws**. The bonus equals your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of +1).

### Extra Attack (6th level)

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Song of Defense (10th level)

*You can direct your magic to absorb damage while your Bladesong is active.*

When you **take damage**, you can use your **reaction** to **expend one spell slot** and **reduce that damage** by an amount equal to **5 times the spell slot's level**.

### Song of Victory (14th level)

You add your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of +1) to the **damage** of your **melee weapon attacks** while your **Bladesong is active**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Conjuration

### Conjuration Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy a Conjuration spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Minor Conjuration (2nd level)

You can use your **action** to conjure up an inanimate object in your hand or on the ground in an unoccupied space that you can see **within 10 feet** of you. This object can be **no larger** than **3 feet on a side** and **weigh no more** than **10 pounds**, and its form must be that of **a nonmagical object that you have seen**. The object is visibly magical, radiating **dim light out to 5 feet**.

The object **disappears after 1 hour**, when you **use this feature again**, or if it **takes any damage**.

### Benign Transportation (6th level)

You can use your **action** to **teleport up to 30 feet** to an unoccupied space that you can see.

Alternatively, you can choose a **space within range** that is **occupied** by a **Small or Medium creature**. If that creature is **willing**, you **both teleport**, **swapping** places.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a **long rest** or you **cast a Conjuration spell of 1st level or higher**.

### Focused Conjuration (10th level)

While you are **concentrating** on a **Conjuration spell**, your **concentration can't be broken** as a result of **taking damage**.

### Durable Summons (14th level)

Any **creature** that you **summon** or **create** with a **Conjuration spell** has **30 temporary hit points**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Divination

When you **finish a long rest**, roll **two d20s** and **record the numbers rolled**. You can **replace any check** made by you or a creature that you can see with **one of these foretelling rolls**. You must choose to do so **before the roll**, and you can replace a roll in this way only **once per turn**.

Each foretelling roll can be used only **once**. When you **finish a long rest**, you **lose** any **unused foretelling rolls**.

### Expert Divination (6th level)

*Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts.* 

When you cast a **Divination spell** of **2nd level or higher** using a **spell slot**, you **regain one expended spell slot**. The slot you regain must be of a **level lower than the spell you cast** and **can't be higher than 5th level**.

### The Third Eye (10th level)

**Once between rests,** you can use your **action** to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, **choose one** of the following benefits, which lasts until you are **incapacitated** or you **take** a short or long **rest**.

* **Darkvision:** You gain darkvision out to a range of **60 feet**.
* **Ethereal Sight:** You can **see into the Astral Projection** within **60 feet** of you.
* **Greater Comprehension:** You can read any language.
* **See Invisibility:** You can see invisible creatures and objects within **10 feet** of you that are **within line of sight**.

### Greater Portent (14th level)

*The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come.*

You roll **three d20s** for your **Portent** feature, rather than two.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Enchantment

### Enchantment Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy an Enchantment spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Hypnotic Gaze (2nd level)

*Your soft words and enchanting gaze can magically enthrall another creature.* 

As an **action**, choose **one creature** that you can see within 5 feet of you. If the target can **see or hear** you, it must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Wizard spell save DC** or be **charmed by you** until the **end of your next turn**. The charmed creature's **speed drops to 0**, and the creature is **incapacitated** and visibly disoriented.

On **subsequent turns**, you can use your **action** to **maintain this effect**, **extending** its duration until the **end of your next turn**. However, the effect **ends** if you **move more than 5 feet away** from the creature, if the creature can **neither see nor hear** you, or if the creature **takes damage**.

Once the **effect ends**, or if the **creature succeeds on its initial saving throw** against this effect, you can't use this feature **on that creature** again until you finish a **long rest**.

### Instinctive Charm (6th level)

When a creature you can see **within 30 feet** of you **makes an attack roll against you**, you can use your **reaction** to **divert the attack**, provided that **another** creature **is within the attack's range**. The **attacker** must make a **Wisdom saving throw** against your **Wizard spell save DC**. On a **failed** save, the attacker **must target** the creature that is closest to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the attacker chooses which one to target.

On a **successful** save, you can't use this feature **on the attacker** again until you finish a **long rest**.

You must choose to use this feature **before knowing** whether the attack **hits or misses**. Creatures that **can't be charmed** are **immune** to this effect.

### Split Enchantment (10th level)

When you cast an **Enchantment spell** of **1st level or higher** that **targets only one** creature, you can have it **target a second** creature.

### Alter Memories (14th level)

*You gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical influence on it.* 

When you cast an **Enchantment spell** to **charm** one or more creatures, you can alter **one** creature's understanding so that it remains **unaware of being charmed**.

Additionally, **once** before the spell expires, you can use your **action** to try to make the chosen creature **forget some** of the time it spent charmed. The creature must **succeed** on an **Intelligence saving throw** against your **Wizard spell save DC** or **lose a number of hours of its memories** equal to **1 + your Charisma modifier** (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time, and the amount of time **can't exceed the duration** of your Enchantment spell.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Evocation

### Evocation Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy an Evocation spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Sculpt Spells (2nd level)

*You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells.*

When you cast an **Evocation spell** that **affects other creatures** that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to **1 + the spell's level**. The **chosen creatures automatically succeed** on their **saving throws** against the spell, and they **take no damage** if they would **normally take half damage** on a successful save.

### Potent Cantrip (6th level)

*Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.*

When a creature **succeeds** on a **saving throw** against your **cantrip**, the creature takes **half the cantrip's damage** (if any) but suffers **no additional effect** from the cantrip.

### Empowered Evocation (10th level)

You can add your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of +1) to the **damage roll** of any **Evocation spell** that you cast. The damage bonus applies to **one damage roll** of a spell, not multiple rolls.

### Overchannel (14th level)

*You can increase the power of your simpler spells.*

When you cast an **Evocation spell** of **5th level or lower** that **deals damage** and **isn't a cantrip**, you can **deal maximum damage** with that spell.

The **first time** you do so, you suffer **no adverse effect**. If you use this feature **again** before you finish a **long rest**, you take **2d12 true damage times level of the spell**, immediately after you cast it. **Each time** you use this feature **again** before finishing a long rest, the **damage per spell level increases by 1d12**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Illusion

### Illusion Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy an Illusion spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Improved Minor Illusion (2nd level)

You learn the **Minor Illusion** cantrip for free. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.

When you cast **Minor Illusion**, you can create **both a sound and an image** with a **single casting** of the spell.

### Malleable Illusions (6th level)

*Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect.*

When you cast an **Illusion spell** that has a **duration of 1 minute or longer**, you can use your **action** to **change the nature** of that illusion (using the spell's normal parameters for the illusion), provided that you can see the illusion.

### Illusory Self (10th level)

*You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost instinctual reaction to danger.* 

**Once between rests**, when a creature **makes an attack roll against you**, you can use your **reaction** to interpose the illusory duplicate between the attacker and yourself. The **attack automatically misses** you, then the **illusion dissipates**.

### Illusory Reality (14th level)

*You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your illusions to give them a semi-reality.*

When you cast an **Illusion spell** of **1st level or higher**, you can choose **one inanimate, nonmagical object that is part of the illusion** and make that object **real**. You can do this on your turn as a **bonus action** while the spell is ongoing. The object **remains real for 1 minute**. 

**Hint:** For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

The object **can't deal damage** or otherwise **directly harm** anyone.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Invention

### Bonus Proficiencies

You gain **proficiency** in **Craftsmanship**, or **expertise** if you're already proficient. Moreover, you become **proficient** with **light armor**.

### Magitech Armor (2nd level)

*Innovation is a dangerous practice, at least as far as members of this school practice it. As a shield against this risk, you have developed a suit of arcane armor.*

You gain a suit of **magitech armor**—a magic item that **only you** can attune to. While you are attuned to it and wearing it, it grants you **resistance** to **force damage**.

The armor is **light armor** and provides an **AC** of **12 + your Dexterity modifier**. It weighs 8 pounds.

You can create **a new suit** of it at the end of a **long rest** by **touching a nonmagical suit of studded leather armor**, which magically transforms it. Doing so **removes the magic** from your **previous** magitech armor, turning it into nonmagical studded leather.

### Reckless Casting (2nd level)

*You can attempt to cast a random spell you don’t have prepared.*

When you use this ability, you use your **action** and **choose one** of the following options:

* Roll on the Reckless Casting table for **cantrips** and **cast the resulting spell** as part of this action.
* **Expend a spell slot** and **roll twice** on the Reckless Casting table for **the level of the spell slot**, or the **5th-level** table if the slot is **6th level or higher**. Pick which of the two results you want to use and **cast the resulting spell** as part of this action.

If the spell you cast isn’t a Wizard spell, it is nonetheless a Wizard spell for you when you cast it with this feature.

### Alchemical Casting (6th level)

*You learn to channel magic through your arcanomechanical armor to augment spells in a variety of ways.* 

When you **cast a spell** while wearing your magitech armor and being attuned to it, you can **expend one additional spell slot** of **1st** or **2nd level** to **alter the spell**. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.

A **1st-level** slot allows you to manipulate the spell’s energy. When you cast a spell that deals **acid**, **cold**, **fire**, **lightning**, **shadow** or **sonic** damage, you can substitute that damage type for another one from that list.

A **2nd-level** slot increases the spell’s raw force. If you **roll damage** for the spell when you cast it, **increase that damage** by **2d10 force damage** against **one of the spell’s targets** (your choice) this turn.

### Prodigious Inspiration (10th level)

*You have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation.*

**Once between rests**, as a **bonus action**, you can **replace one spell you have prepared** with **another** spell from **your spellbook**.

### Controlled Chaos (14th level)

*Your ability to improvise magic grows stronger.*

Whenever you roll on a **Reckless Casting** table for a spell **other than a cantrip**, you **can roll** on the table that is **one level higher than the expended spell slot**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Lore Mastery

### Lore Mastery (2nd level)

- You gain **expertise** in a number of **knowledge skills** equal to your **Intelligence modifier**, with a minimum of 1. You **must have proficiency** in a skill in order to select it for this feature.
- You can roll **Intelligence** for **Initiative** rather than **Dexterity**.

### Spell Secrets (2nd level)

*You can alter existing spells in a few ways.*

#### Different saving throw

**Once between rests** you can **change** the type of the **saving throw** related to a spell being cast. 

*Doing this on the fly is very difficult, therefore can only pull it off once in a while.*

#### Spell variations

You are able to create variations of existing spells. Those variations count as **separate spells** and therefore have to be **prepared separately** from the parent spell. When modifying a spell, you can either try to modify it **within the same element(s)**, or **change the element** as well.

##### Same element

Modifying a spell within the same set of elements allows you to **change the damage type** to one of those assigned to either of the elements from that set.

In this case, you **don't have to write the modified spell in your spellbook**. The changes are small enough for you to remember them by heart. However, you still need to **memorize** the spell **separately**.

##### Different elements

When you're changing the used elements, you **need to write the modified spell down** in the spellbook, as it will require a different type of ink. It's a normal **process of adding a spell**, except it **takes twice the time**.

Changing the elements behind the spell might be a serious modification that might influence the entire effect of the spell and even **change the saving throws**. Simple offensive spells will usually not be altered that much, but more complex ones will likely have to be discussed.

##### Elemental damage types

| Element         | Damage types                             |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Fire**        | fire, radiant, lightning                 |
| **Earth**       | bludgeoning, acid, force                 |
| **Light**       | fire, radiant, lightning                 |
| **Death**       | cold, necrotic, poison                   |
| **Darkness**    | slashing, piercing, shadow, poison, acid |
| **Aether**      | ethereal, force, sonic                   |
| **Air**         | cold, lightning, force, sonic            |
| **Water**       | slashing, bludgeoning, cold, acid        |
| **Demonology*** | fire, cold, necrotic, shadow             |

<sup>*Technically, Demonology is not an element, but rather a type of magic that combines various elements.</sup>

### Alchemical Casting (6th level)

*You learn to augment spells in a variety of ways.* 

When you **cast a spell with a spell slot**, you can **expend one additional spell slot** to augment its effects for this casting, imbuing the spell with additional energy derived from the given circle. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.

An additional **1st-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s raw force. If you **roll damage** for the spell when you cast it, **increase the damage against every target** by **2d10 force damage**. If the spell can **deal damage** on **more than one turn**, it deals this **extra** force damage **only on the turn you cast** the spell.

An additional **2nd-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s range. If the spell’s range is **at least 30 feet**, it becomes **1 mile**. If the spell's range is **below 30 feet**, it becomes **30 feet**.

An additional **3rd-level spell slot** can increase the spell’s potency. Increase the spell’s save **DC** by **2**.

### Prodigious Memory (10th level)

*You have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation.*

**Once between rests**, as a **bonus action**, you can **replace one spell you have prepared** with **another** spell from **your spellbook**.

Moreover, you now **no longer have** to **create separate spells** when changing the damage type **without changing the elements**. You can do it **on the fly** the **number of times per day** equal to your **Intelligence modifier**.

### Master of Magic (14th level)

*Your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell.*

Once per day, as a **bonus action**, you can call to mind the ability to cast **one spell** of your choice from **any class’s spell list**. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you **mustn’t have it prepared**, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isn’t a Wizard spell, it counts as a Wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell **vanishes** from your mind **when you cast it** or when the **current turn ends**.

You can also use this feature as an **action** after the **enemy casts a spell** instead. You then make an **Arcana check** in attempt to identify the spell, with the **DC** equal to **15 + the spell's level**. If you **succeed**, you can **later attempt to recreate the spell** (this takes **twice the time of normal spell addition**). The spell is **fresh** in your memory **until the next long rest**. Past that point, you need to make an **Intelligence check** in order to recall the details, against the **DC of 10 + twice the number of long rests since identifying the spell**. On a **failure**, you **forget the spell**, however you keep the progress achieved up to this point (in hours). On a success, you can continue the process.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Necromancy

### Necromancy Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy a Necromancy spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Grim Harvest (2nd level)

*You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill with your spells.*

**Once per turn** when you **kill one or more** creatures with a **spell of 1st level or higher**, you **regain hit points** equal to **twice the spell's level**, or **three times its level** if the spell belongs to the School of **Necromancy**. You don't gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

### Undead Thralls (6th level)

You add the **Animate Dead** spell to your **spellbook** if it is not there already. When you **cast Animate Dead**, you can target **one additional corpse** or **pile of bones**, creating **another zombie or skeleton**, as appropriate.

Whenever you **create an undead** using a **Necromancy spell**, it has additional benefits:

* The creature's **hit point maximum** is **increased** by an amount equal to **your Wizard level**.
* The creature **adds your proficiency bonus** to its **weapon damage rolls**.

### Inured to Undeath (10th level)

*You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.*

You have **resistance** to **necrotic damage**, and your **hit point maximum** can't be reduced. 

### Command Undead (14th level)

*You can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those created by other wizards.*

As an **action**, you can **choose one undead** that you can see **within 60 feet** of you. That creature must make a **Charisma saving throw** against your **Wizard spell save DC**. If it **succeeds**, you **can't use this feature on it again**. If it **fails**, it becomes friendly to you and o**beys your commands** until **you use this feature again**.

**Intelligent undead** are harder to control in this way. If the target has an **Intelligence of 8 or higher**, it has **advantage** on the saving throw. If it **fails** the saving throw and has an **Intelligence of 12 or higher**, it can **repeat** the saving throw at the **end of every hour** until it succeeds and breaks free.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Theurgy

### Prerequisite: Wisdom

*Combining divine and arcane magic requires advanced comprehension of both.*

You must have at least **13 Wisdom** to choose this subclass.

### Arcane Initiate (2nd level)

Choose a **cleric domain** from your chosen deity’s list of eligible domains. At later levels, you will gain features from that domain.

Whenever you **gain a Wizard level**, you can **replace one** of the Wizard **spells you add** to your spellbook with a **Cleric domain spell for your chosen domain**. The spell must be of a level for which you have Wizard spell slots.

If you add **all of your domain spells** to your spellbook, you can subsequently **add any spell from the base Cleric spell list** instead. The spell must still be of a level for which you have Wizard spell slots.

Any Cleric spell you gain from this feature is considered a Wizard spell for you, but other Wizards can’t copy Cleric spells from your spellbook into their own spellbooks.

### Channel Arcana (2nd, 6th, 18th level)

*You gain the ability to channel arcane energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects.*

You start with two effects: **Divine Arcana** and the **Channel Divinity** option **granted at 2nd level by your chosen domain**. You employ that Channel Divinity option by using your Channel Arcana ability.

You can use Channel Arcana **once between rests**. When you use your Channel Arcana, you choose which effect to create.

Some Channel Arcana effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect, the **save DC** equals your **Wizard spell save DC**.

Beginning at **6th level**, you can use your Channel Arcana **twice between rests**, and beginning at **18th level**, you can use it **three times between rests**.

If you gain additional Channel Divinity options from your domain, you can employ them by using your Channel Arcana feature.

### Domain Feature I (6th level)

You gain your chosen domain’s **1st-level** benefits. However, you do not gain any weapon or armor **proficiencies** from the domain.

### Domain Feature II (10th level)

*Your faith and your understanding of magic allow you to delve into your god’s secrets.*

You gain your chosen domain’s **6th-level** benefits.

### Domain Feature IV (14th level)

*Your academic nature and understanding of magic and doctrine allow you to master this ability sooner than a cleric of your domain.*

You gain your chosen domain’s **17th-level** benefits.

**Note:** **Domain Feature III** being skipped is not an error - Cleric domains provide a feature at 8th level, which theurgists **don't** acquire.

## Arcane Tradition: School of Transmutation

### Transmutation Savant (2nd level)

The **gold and time** you must spend to copy a Transmutation spell into your spellbook is **halved**.

### Minor Alchemy (2nd level)

*You can temporarily alter the physical properties of one nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another.*

You perform a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of **wood**, **stone** (but not a gemstone), **iron**, **copper**, or **silver**, transforming it into a different one of those materials. For each **10 minutes** you spend performing the procedure, you can transform **up to 1 cubic foot** of material. After **1 hour**, or until you **lose your concentration** (as if you were concentrating on a spell), the material **reverts** to its original substance.

### Transumter's Stone (6th level)

You can spend **8 hours** creating a **transmuter's stone** that stores Transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone **yourself** or **give it to another** creature. A creature gains a **benefit of your choice** as long as the stone is in the creature's possession. When you create the stone, choose the benefit from the following options:

* **Darkvision** out to a range of **60 feet**
* An **increase to speed of 10 feet** while the creature is unencumbered
* **Proficiency** in **Constitution saving throws**
* **Resistance** to **acid**, **cold**, **fire**, **lightning**, or **thunder** damage (your choice whenever you choose this benefit)

Each time you cast a **Transmutation spell** of **1st level or higher**, you can **change the effect** of your stone **if the stone is on your person**.

If you **create a new** transmuter's stone, the **previous one ceases to function**.

### Shapechanger (10th level)

*You have spent so much time dealing with undead and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of their worst effects.*

You add the **Polymorph** spell to your spellbook, if it is not there already. 

Once between rests, you can cast Polymorph **without expending a spell slot**. When you do so, you can **target only yourself** and transform into a **beast** whose **CR is 1 or lower**.

### Master Transmuter (14th level)

You can use your **action** to consume the reserve of Transmutation magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do so, choose **one** of the following effects. Your **transmuter's stone** is **destroyed** and **can't be remade** until you finish a **long rest**.

* **Major Transformation:** You can transmute **one nonmagical object** – **no larger than a 5-foot cube** – into **another nonmagical object** of **similar size and mass** and of **equal or lesser value**. You must spend **10 minutes** handling the object to transform it.
* **Panacea:** You remove **all curses**, **diseases**, and **poisons** affecting a creature that you **touch** with the **transmuter's stone**. The creature also **regains all its hit points**.
* **Restore Life:** You cast the **Raise Dead** spell on a creature you **touch** with the **transmuter's stone**, **without expending a spell slot** or **needing to have the spell** in your spellbook.
* **Restore Youth:** You **touch** the **transmuter's stone** to a **willing** creature, and that creature's **apparent age is reduced** by **3d10 years**, to a **minimum of 13 years**. This effect **doesn't extend** the creature's **lifespan**.

## Arcane Tradition: School of War Magic

You become **proficient** with **light armor** and **shields**.

### Arcane Deflection (2nd level)

*You have learned to weave your magic to fortify yourself against harm.*

When you are **hit by an attack** or you **fail a saving throw**, you can use your **reaction** to gain a **+2** bonus to your **AC** **against that attack** or a +**4** bonus to that **saving throw**.

When you use this feature, you **can’t cast spells other than cantrips** until the **end of your next turn**.

You can give yourself a **bonus** to your **Initiative rolls** equal to your **Intelligence modifier**.

### Power Surge (6th level)

*You can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells.*

You can store a **maximum number** of **power surges** equal to your **Intelligence modifier** (minimum of one). Whenever you **finish a long rest**, your number of **power surges** **resets to one**. Whenever you **successfully** end a spell with **Dispel Magic** or **Counterspell**, you **gain one power surge**, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled.

If you end a **short rest** with **no power surges**, you **gain one power surge**.

**Once per turn** when you **deal damage** to a creature or object with a **Wizard spell**, you can **spend one power surge** to deal **extra force damage** to that target. The extra damage equals **half your Wizard level**.

### Durable Magic (10th level)

While you **maintain concentration** on a spell, you have a **+2** bonus to **AC** and **all saving throws**.

### Deflecting Shroud (14th level)
