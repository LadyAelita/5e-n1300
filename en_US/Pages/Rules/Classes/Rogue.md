| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Armor**         | **Light**                                                    |

### Languages

You know **thieves' cant**, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Multiclass requirement

You must have a **Dexterity** score of **13 or higher** in order to multiclass into this class.

---

## Expertise (1st, 6th level)

Choose **two** of your **skill proficiencies**. You gain **expertise** in those two skills instead.

At **6th level**, you can choose **two additional skills** this way.

## Sneak Attack (1st level)

*You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction.*

**Once per turn**, you can deal an **extra damage**, as shown in the Rogue table, to **one creature** you **hit** with an **attack if you have advantage** on the attack roll. The attack must use a **Dexterity-based weapon**.

You **don't need advantage** on the attack roll if **another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it**, that enemy **isn't incapacitated**, and you **don't have disadvantage** on the attack roll.

**Critical multipliers**, if any, are **applied after** the **Sneak Attack** damage, meaning that **Sneak Attack** damage **can crit** as well.

## Cunning Action (2nd level)

*Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.*

You can use your **bonus action** to take the **Dash**, **Disengage**, or **Hide** action.

## Uncanny Dodge (5th level)

When an **attacker** that you can see **hits you** with an attack, you can use your **reaction** to **halve** the attack's **damage** against you.

## Evasion (7th level)

*You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell.* 

You gain **Evasion**. Therefore, when you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

## Reliable Talent (11th level)

*You have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection.*

Whenever you make an **ability check** that **lets you add your proficiency** bonus, you can **treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower** as **a natural 10**.

## Blindsense (14th level)

If you are **able to hear**, you are **aware of the location** of any **hidden** or **invisible creature within 10 feet** of you.

## Slippery Mind (15th level)

*You have acquired greater mental strength.*

You gain **proficiency** in **Wisdom** saving throws.

## Elusive (18th level)

*You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you.*

**No attack** roll **has advantage against you** while you aren't incapacitated.

## Stroke of Luck (20th level)

*You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to.*

Once between rests, if **your attack misses** a target, you **can turn the miss into a hit**. Alternatively, if you **fail** an **ability check**, you can **treat it as a natural 20 instead**.

# Roguish Archetypes

## List of Roguish Archetypes

* **Arcane Trickster:** Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.
* **Assassin:** You focus your training on the grim art of death. Those who adhere to this archetype are diverse: hired killers, spies, bounty hunters, and even specially anointed priests trained to exterminate the enemies of their deity. Stealth, poison, and disguise help you eliminate your foes with deadly efficiency.
* **Detective:** As an archetypal Detective, you excel at rooting out secrets and unraveling mysteries. You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your sharp eye make you well equipped to expose and end hidden evils.
* **Manipulator:** Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have. Many spies, courtiers, and schemers follow this archetype, leading lives of intrigue. Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.
* **Scout:** You are skilled in stealth and surviving far from the streets of a city, allowing you to scout ahead of your companions during expeditions. Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter â€“ these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.
* **Shadow:** Bare night knows you by name, and in the dark you feel at home. You combine your martial training with shadow magic, allowing you to strike out of nowhere at unsuspecting targets, eliminating them rapidly and getting away unscathed, all in a matter of seconds.
* **Swashbuckler:** You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance. Duelists and pirates typically belong to this archetype. A Swashbuckler excels in single combat, and can fight with two weapons while safely darting away from an opponent.
* **Thief:** You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn't employ.

### Impostor  (13th level)

*You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person's speech, writing, and behavior.*

You can use the **Help** action as a **bonus action**. Additionally, when you use the **Help** action to **aid an ally in attacking** a creature, the **target** of that attack **can be within 30 feet** of you, rather than 5 feet of you, if the **ally can hear you**.

When you are in **dim light** or **darkness**, as a **bonus action** you can **teleport up to 60 feet** to an unoccupied **space** you can see that is **also** in **dim light** or **darkness**. You then have **advantage** on the **first melee attack** you make **before the end of the turn**.

### Panache (9th level)

*Your charm becomes extraordinarily beguiling.*

As an **action**, you can make a **Persuasion check contested** by a creature's **Insight check**. The creature must be able to **hear you**, and the two of you must **share a language**.

If you **succeed** on the check and the **creature is hostile** to you, it **has disadvantage on attack** rolls **against targets other than you** and **can't make opportunity attacks against targets other than you**. This effect lasts for **1 minute**, until **one of your companions attacks the target** or **affects it with a spell**, or until **you and the target** are **more than 60 feet apart**.

If you **succeed** on the check and the **creature isn't hostile** to you, it is **charmed by you** for **1 minute**. While charmed, it **regards you as a friendly** acquaintance. This effect **ends** immediately if **you or your companions do anything harmful to it**.
