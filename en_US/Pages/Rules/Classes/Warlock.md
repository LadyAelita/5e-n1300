[gimmick:title](Warlock)

# Warlock

**Warlocks**, also known as vilosi (which is plural of **vilos**) are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. It is that ancient, eldritch magic that oversees the pacts that warlocks make with mysterious beings of supernatural power - ones that cannot be broken by either party without extraordinary effort. These pacts mutate the body of a warlock (in a visible or invisible manner), biologically granting them the ability to manipulate magical energy, substituting for the lack of innate magical talent. 

Vilosi invoke their pacts to regain their strength, fuel their magic. To reach their full potential. But at what cost?

## Eldrtich Invocations (2nd level)

*In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.*

You learn a number of invocations from the Eldritch Invocations list, as per the Warlock table. There exist four tiers of eldritch invocations, each one with a different Warlock level requirement.

| Eldritch Invocation tier | Required Warlock level |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Least**                | 2                      |
| **Lesser**               | 5                      |
| **Greater**              | 12                     |
| **Dark**                 | 19                     |

Moreover, there exist the following categories of invocations:

| Invocation Category | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Blast Shape**     | Eldritch Invocations that in any way allow you to modify the *Eldritch Blast* cantrip. **All such invocations require access to *Eldritch Blast*.** |
| **General**         | Invocations that grant you various benefits, not suited for any of the remaining categories. |
| **Meta**            | Invocations that modify the effects of spells you cast.      |
| **Spell-Like**      | Invocations that grant you access, usually at-will, to spells outside of your regular pact magic and mystic arcana. |

Additionally, each time you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of the invocations you know with another one, using your **current** Warlock level for the requirement. This is **in addition** to learning a new invocation, rather than instead of it - you can **both** learn a new invocation **and** replace an old one during the same level up.

## Pact Boon (3rd level)

*Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you as part of your pact.* 

You get to pick a **second** subclass. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again and 7th and 14th level.

## Pact Inquiry (5th, 9th level)

As an **action**, **once per day**, you entreat your patron for aid, regaining **1d4** of your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

From 9th level onwards, you can use this feature **twice per day** instead.

## Mystic Arcanum (11th, 13th, 15th, 17th level)

*You have unearthed a magical secret called an Arcanum.*

Choose **one 6th-level spell** from the Warlock spell list as this Arcanum. You also gain access to **one 6th-level Arcanum spell slot**.

You can expend your **Mystic Arcanum spell slot** to cast **either one** of your **Mystic Arcana** spells of **the same or smaller level** as that of the Arcanum spell slot. 

You can also use **Mystic Arcana spell slots** to cast the spells you know through **Pact Magic**. 

You regain all your expended Mystic Arcana spell slots on a **long rest**.

At each of the levels 13, 15 and 17, you gain a **Mystic Arcanum** spell and a corresponding spell slot of, respectively, 7th, 8th and 9th circle.

## Transcendent Arcanum (20th level)

*Your study of otherworldly arcana has allowed you to uncover a secret long forgotten.*

You gain access to **one 10th-level Arcanum spell slot**, which works just as your other Mystic Arcana spell slots - you can use it to cast other spells you know at 10th level.

Choose **one 9th-level spell** from **any class' spell list** as your Transcendent Arcanum. You can **only** cast this spell through your **Transcendent Arcanum spell slot**.

You regain your Transcendent Arcanum spell slot on a **long rest**.

## List of Pact Boons

* **Pact of the Blade:** You are given a weapon that makes use of your magic in order to boost your martial skills.
* **Pact of the Chain:** An extraplanar creature serves you as a familiar with extended capabilities.
* **Pact of the Tome:** A script of forgotten lore about spells that would otherwise be beyond your reach.

## Pact Boon: Pact of the Blade

### Pact Weapon (3rd level)

You can use your **action** to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this **melee** weapon takes each time you create it. You are **proficient** with it while you wield it. This weapon deals damage of **magical** origin.

You can use your pact weapon as a **spellcasting focus**.

Your pact weapon **disappears** if you **dismiss** it (**at will**, no action required, although you must be **holding it** to do so).

You can **transform** an **existing** weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual, while you **hold** the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of **1 hour**, which can be done **during a short rest**.

You can then **dismiss** the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and **it** appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect a **sentient** weapon in this way. The weapon **ceases being your pact weapon** if you **die**, if you perform the 1-hour **ritual** on a **different** weapon, or if you **use a 1-hour ritual** to **break** your bond to it. The weapon **appears at your feet** if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.

### Extra Attack (7th level)

You can attack twice instead of once on each turn, as long as you're attacking with your pact weapon.

### Hex Warrior (14th level)

You add your Charisma modifier to the damage you deal with your pact weapon.

### Pact Servant (3rd Level)

You learn the *Find Familiar* spell and can cast it as a **ritual**. The spell **doesn't count** against your number of **spells known**.

When you cast the spell, you can choose **one of the normal forms** for your familiar **or one of the following special forms**: imp, pseudodragon, hellion, sprite or phase eyeling.

As long as your familiar is on the same plane of existence as you and is currently under your command, your **spellcasting focus** component is considered as satisfied.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can **forgo one of your own attacks** to **allow your familiar** to use its **reaction** to **make one attack of its own**.

### Gift of Vitality (7th level)

Your familiar's maximum health is increased by your Warlock level.

### Gift of Resistance (14th level)

As long as your familiar is **within 5 feet of you**, you are **resistant** to everything your familiar is **resistant or immune** to, except for piercing, slashing or bludgeoning damage.

## Pact Boon: Pact of the Tome

### Script of Shadows (3rd level)

Your patron gives you a **book** or a **large scroll**. When you gain this feature, choose **three cantrips** from **any class' spell list** (the three needn't be from the same list). While the script is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They **don't count** against your number of **cantrips known**. If they don't appear on the Warlock spell list, they are nonetheless **Warlock spells** for **you**.

You can use your Script of Shadows as a **spellcasting focus**.

If you **lose** your script, you can perform a **1-hour ceremony** to receive a **replacement** from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a **short** or **long** rest, and it **destroys the previous book**.

### Inscribed Rituals (7th level)

You can choose **three spells with the ritual tag** from **any class' spell list** (the three needn't be from the same list) of 3rd or lower level. While your Script of Shadows is on your person, you can cast those spells **as rituals**, without expending spell slots. They **don't count** against your number of **spells known**. If they don't appear on the Warlock spell list, they are nonetheless **Warlock spells** for **you**.

### Warlock's Elaboration (14th level)

You add **one spell of 6th or lower level** from **any class' spell list** to your Script of Shadows. As long as it's on your person, you can cast this spell **once a day without expending a spell slot**.

# Otherworldly Patrons

## List of Otherworldly Patrons

* **The Aeonian Flame:** Whether you've made a pact with a deity, or the Flame itself, your patron is a force of good. You are able to harness the healing power of light and the righteous fury of fire.
* **The Archfey:** Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical.
* **The Fiend:** You have made a pact with a demon from the Infernal Plane, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you.
* **The Great Old One:** Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds.
* **The Seeker:** Your patron is an inscrutable being who seeks knowledge and secrets. In return for your patron’s gifts, you wander the world seeking lore that you can share with the Seeker.
* **The Undying:** Death holds no sway over your patron, who has unlocked the secrets of everlasting life, although such a prize – like all power – comes at a price. Once mortal, the Undying has seen mortal lifetimes pass like the seasons, like the flicker of endless days and nights. It has the secrets of the ages to share, secrets of life and death.
* **The Void:** You have made a pact with a creature from the Void, a personification of absence and nothingness, giving you command over those concepts.

You regain **hit points** equal to **half your hit point maximum**, regaining complete consciousness, and then you **stand up** if you so choose. Each creature of your choice that is **within 30 feet** of you takes **radiant damage** equal to **2d8 + your Charisma modifier**, and **is blinded** until the **end of your next turn**.

*You can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm.*

### Beguiling Defenses (10th level)

*Your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them.*

You are **immune** to being **charmed**, and when another creature **attempts to charm** you, you can use your **reaction** to **attempt to turn the charm back** on that creature.

You can choose **one damage type** when you **finish** a short or long **rest**. You gain **resistance** to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from **magical weapons** or **silver weapons** ignores this resistance.

### See You In Hell (18th level)

*You are able to execute a desperate, spiteful attack against a foe.* 

**Once per day**, whenever you **hit** a creature with a **charging strike** or **have the creature grappled**, you can briefly open a portal (no action needed), teleporting **both** yourself and that creature to either **Hell** or **Abyss** (your choice).

*As both of you are hurled through the foul, abhorrent landscapes of that plane, you struggle in seemingly everlasting combat against each other.* The fight lasts only **6 seconds** on the **Terrestrial Plane**, but **2 hours** in **Hell**. Therefore, this feature **ends all effects** affecting you or your target with a **remaining duration smaller than 2 hours**.

At the **start of your next turn**, you take **5d8 bludgeoning damage** and **5d8** of either **hellfire** or **supernatural cold** damage (for Hell and Abyss respectively). Your target instead takes **5d10 bludgeoning**, **5d10 hellfire/supernatural cold**, and **5d10 psychic** damage. If the target is a creature **native** to the plane of **Hell**, it **doesn't take** the **psychic** damage.

If **any** of you **survive** the damage, another portal opens in a **location of your choice within 30 feet of the previous one**, and those that have **survived** the infernal voyage **drop out**, falling **prone** in the nearest unoccupied space (you choose for both creatures if there are many such spaces). Those that have **dropped to 0 hit** points **remain in Hell**.

You can **communicate telepathically** with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on **the same plane** of existence.
