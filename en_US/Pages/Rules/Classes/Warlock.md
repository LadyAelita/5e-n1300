[gimmick:title](Warlock)

# Warlock

**Warlocks**, also known as vilosi (which is plural of **vilos**) are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. It is that ancient, eldritch magic that oversees the pacts that warlocks make with mysterious beings of supernatural power - ones that cannot be broken by either party without extraordinary effort. These pacts mutate the body of a warlock (in a visible or invisible manner), biologically granting them the ability to manipulate magical energy, substituting for the lack of innate magical talent. 

Vilosi invoke their pacts to regain their strength, fuel their magic. To reach their full potential. But at what cost?

## Eldrtich Invocations (2nd level)

*In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.*

You learn a number of invocations from the Eldritch Invocations list, as per the Warlock table. There exist four tiers of eldritch invocations, each one with a different Warlock level requirement.

| Eldritch Invocation tier | Required Warlock level |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Least**                | 2                      |
| **Lesser**               | 5                      |
| **Greater**              | 12                     |
| **Dark**                 | 19                     |

Moreover, there exist the following categories of invocations:

| Invocation Category | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Blast Shape**     | Eldritch Invocations that in any way allow you to modify the *Eldritch Blast* cantrip. **All such invocations require access to *Eldritch Blast*.** |
| **General**         | Invocations that grant you various benefits, not suited for any of the remaining categories. |
| **Meta**            | Invocations that modify the effects of spells you cast.      |
| **Spell-Like**      | Invocations that grant you access, usually at-will, to spells outside of your regular pact magic and mystic arcana. |

Additionally, each time you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of the invocations you know with another one, using your **current** Warlock level for the requirement. This is **in addition** to learning a new invocation, rather than instead of it - you can **both** learn a new invocation **and** replace an old one during the same level up.

## Pact Boon (3rd level)

*Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you as part of your pact.* 

You get to pick a **second** subclass. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again and 7th and 14th level.

## Pact Inquiry (5th, 9th level)

As an **action**, **once per day**, you entreat your patron for aid, regaining **1d4** of your expended Pact Magic spell slots.

From 9th level onwards, you can use this feature **twice per day** instead.

## Mystic Arcanum (11th, 13th, 15th, 17th level)

*You have unearthed a magical secret called an Arcanum.*

Choose **one 6th-level spell** from the Warlock spell list as this Arcanum. You also gain access to **one 6th-level Arcanum spell slot**.

You can expend your **Mystic Arcanum spell slot** to cast **either one** of your **Mystic Arcana** spells of **the same or smaller level** as that of the Arcanum spell slot. 

You can also use **Mystic Arcana spell slots** to cast the spells you know through **Pact Magic**. 

You regain all your expended Mystic Arcana spell slots on a **long rest**.

At each of the levels 13, 15 and 17, you gain a **Mystic Arcanum** spell and a corresponding spell slot of, respectively, 7th, 8th and 9th circle.

## Transcendent Arcanum (20th level)

*Your study of otherworldly arcana has allowed you to uncover a secret long forgotten.*

You gain access to **one 10th-level Arcanum spell slot**, which works just as your other Mystic Arcana spell slots - you can use it to cast other spells you know at 10th level.

Choose **one 9th-level spell** from **any class' spell list** as your Transcendent Arcanum. You can **only** cast this spell through your **Transcendent Arcanum spell slot**.

You regain your Transcendent Arcanum spell slot on a **long rest**.
