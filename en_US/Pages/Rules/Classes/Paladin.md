---

## Divine Sense (1st level)

*The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.*

A **number of times per day**, equal to **1 + your Charisma modifier**, as an **action**, you can open your awareness to **detect** such forces. Until the **end of your next turn**, you **know the location** of any **celestial**, **fiend**, or **undead within 60 feet** of you that is **not behind total cover**. You **know the type** (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but **not its identity** (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the **same radius**, you also **detect the presence** of any **place or object** that has been **consecrated or desecrated**, as with the Hallow spell.

## Lay on Hands (1st level)

*Your blessed touch can heal wounds.*

You have a **pool of healing** power, with which you can **restore** a **total number of hit points per day** equal to **your Paladin level x 5**.

As an action, you can **touch a creature** and draw power from the pool to **restore a number of hit points to that creature**. **up to the maximum amount remaining** in your pool.

Alternatively, you can **expend 5 hit points from your pool** of healing to **cure** the target of **one disease** or neutralize **one poison** affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

Your healing power is either of **radiant** or **necrotic** nature. A **radiant** pool allows you to heal **everybody except undead and constructs**. A **necrotic** power allows you to heal **only undead**. You make the choice during character creation and cannot change it, unless your DM allows you to.

## Fighting Style (2nd level)

*You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.*

Choose **one** of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

* **Defense:** While you're wearing any armor, you gain +1 to AC.
* **Dueling:** When you are wielding a **melee weapon in one hand** and **no other weapons**, you gain a **+2 bonus to damage rolls** with that weapon.
* **Great Weapon Fighting:** Whenever you roll a **1** or **2** on a damage die for an attack you make with a **two-handed weapon** or a **versatile** weapon you're wielding with **two-hands**, you can **reroll the die** and **must use the new** roll.
* **Mariner:** If you're **not** wearing **heavy armor** or using a **shield**, you have a **swim
* **Protection:** When a **creature you can see** **attacks** a **target other than you** that is **within 5 feet of you**, you can use your **reaction** to impose **disadvantage** on the **attack roll**. You **must** be **wielding a** shield.
* **Tunnel Fighter:** As a **bonus action**, you can **enter a defensive stance** until the **start of your next turn**. While **in that stance**, you can make **opportunity attacks** for free, **without** using your **reaction**, and creatures **within your reach** **provoke** opportunity attacks **from you** whenever **they move more than 5 feet**, regardless of whether they leave your reach or not.
* **Two-Weapon Fighting:** While **dual wielding**, whenever you **miss** a **main hand** attack and your **next attack** within the **same turn** is an **offhand** attack, you have **advantage** on **that offhand attack**.

## Spellcasting (2nd level)

| Property                  | Value/description                                            |

| **Cantrips**              | **No**                                                       |
| **Learning spells**       | You **don't learn spells**. You know **every Paladin spell** of levels for which you have Paladin spell slots. |
| **Preparing spells**      | On a **long rest**, you can **prepare** a number of Paladin spells equal to your **Charisma modifier + half your Paladin level** (rounded down, minimum of one spell). Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have Paladin spell slots.<br />Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.<br />Preparing a new set of Paladin spells requires takes at least **1 minute per spell level** for **each spell** on your list.<br />Each Sacred Oath has a list of **oath spells** that you gain at specific Paladin levels provided in the description. Once you gain an oath spell, you **always** have it **prepared** and it **doesn't count** against the number of spells you can prepare each day. |

## Divine Smite (2nd level)

When you **hit** a creature with a **melee weapon attack**, you can **expend one spell slot** to deal additional **radiant** or **necrotic** damage to the target. The extra damage is **2d8** for a **1st-level spell slot**, plus **1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st**, to a **maximum of 5d8**.

The **radiant** damage **increases** by **1d8** if the target is an **undead** or a **fiend**, or the **necrotic** damage **increases** by **1d8** if the target is a **celestial**, to a **maximum of 6d8**.

You make the choice between **radiant** and **necrotic** during character creation and can't change it unless the DM allows you to do so.

## Divine Health (3rd level)

The divine magic flowing through you makes you **immune** to **disease**.

## Channel Divinity (3rd level)

*You gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects.*

You start with Channel Divinity options defined by your oath. Some oaths may grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the description.

**Once between rests**, you can use your Channel Divinity, choosing which effect you wish to create. This requires **no action** unless specified otherwise in the chosen effect's description.

Some Channel Divinity effects require **saving throws**. When you use such an effect from this class, the **DC** equals your Paladin **spell save DC**.

## Extra Attack (5th level)

You can attack **twice**, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Aura of Protection (6th, 18th level)

Whenever **you** or a **friendly creature within 10 feet** of you must make a **saving throw**, the creature gains a **bonus** to the saving throw equal to **your Charisma modifier** (with a minimum bonus of +1). You **must be conscious** to grant this bonus.

At **18th level**, the **range** of this aura increases to **30 feet**.

## Aura of Courage (10th level)

**You** and **friendly creatures within 10 feet** of you **can't be frightened** while **you are conscious**.

At **18th level**, the **range** of this aura increases to **30 feet**.

## Improved Divine Smite (11th level)

*You are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them.*

Whenever you **hit** a creature with a **melee weapon**, the creature takes an **extra** **1d8** **radiant** or **necrotic** (depending on your earlier choice) damage.

## Cleansing Touch (14th level)

A **number of times per day** equal to your **Charisma modifier** (a minimum of once), you can use your **action** to **end one spell** on **yourself** or on **one willing creature that you touch**.

# Sacred Oaths

## List of Sacred Oaths

* **Oath of the Ancients:** The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.
* **Oath of Conquest:** The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn’t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might. Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of The Infernal Plane, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Verdelet, the Master of Ceremonies at the Infernal Court, counts many of these paladins – called hell knights – as his most ardent supporters.
* **Oath of the Crown:** The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together. These paladins are the watchful guardians on the walls, standing against the chaotic tides of barbarism that threaten to tear down all that civilization has built, and are commonly known as guardians, exemplars, or sentinels. Often, paladins who swear this oath are members of an order of knighthood in service to a nation or a sovereign, and undergo their oath as part of their admission to the order's ranks.
* **Oath of Devotion:** The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels – the perfect servants of good – as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.
* **Oath of Redemption:** The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning them to the light, and the paladins slay them only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers. While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, the paladins bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.
* **Oath of Treachery:** The Oath of Treachery is the path followed by paladins who have forsworn other oaths or who care only for their own power and survival - these profane warriors, also known as rogue knights, are faithful only to themselves. Anyone desperate enough to follow one of these paladins does so because, while deceitful, these paladins command great power. Those who follow them without falling prey to their treachery hope to indulge in wanton violence and accumulate great treasure. Many of these paladins pay homage to demons, especially Jezebeth, although even the Lords of Hell are loath to ally with these champions of chaos.
* **Oath of Vengeance:** The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside – at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins – sometimes called avengers or dark knights – their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.
* **Oathbreaker:** An oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks their sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart been extinguished. Only darkness remains.

## Sacred Oath: Ancients

### Tenets of the Ancients

The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

**Kindle the Light:** Through thy acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, thou shalt kindle the light of hope in the world, beating back despair.

**Shelter the Light:** Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, thou shalt stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, thou shalt stand against the forces that would render it barren.

**Preserve Your Own Light:** Thou shalt delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. Shalt thou allow the light to die in thine own heart, thou canst not preserve it in the world.

**Be the Light:** Thou shalt be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of thy joy and courage shine forth in all thy deeds.

* At the **start of each of your turns**, you **regain 10 hit points**.

## Sacred Oath: Conquest

### Tenets of Conquest

A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of conquest seared on the upper arm.

**Douse the Flame of Hope:** It is not enough to merely defeat an enemy in battle. Thy victory must be so overwhelming that thy enemies’ will to fight is shattered forever. A blade can end a life. Fear can end an empire.

**Rule with an Iron Fist:** Once thy hast conquered, tolerate no dissent. Thy word is law. Those who obey it shall be favored. Those who defy it shall be punished as an example to all who might follow.

**Strength Above All:** Thou shalt rule until a stronger one arises. Then thy must grow mightier and meet the challenge, or fall to thy own ruin.

*You can use your Channel Divinity to strike with supernatural accuracy.*

When you **make an attack** roll, you can use your Channel Divinity to gain a **+10 bonus** to the roll. You make this choice **after** you **see the roll**, but **before** the DM says whether the attack **hits or misses**.

## Sacred Oath: Crown

### Tenets of the Crown

The tenets of the Oath of the Crown are often set by the sovereign to which their oath is sworn, but generally emphasize the following tenets.

**Law:** The law is paramount. It is the mortar that holds the stones of civilization together, and it shalt be respected.

**Loyalty:** Thy word is thy bond. Without loyalty, oaths and laws are meaningless.

**Courage:** Thou must be willing to do what needs to be done for the sake of order, even in the face of overwhelming odds. Shalt thou not act, who will?

**Responsibility:** Thou shalt deal with the consequences of your actions, for thou art responsible for fulfilling thy duties and obligations.

## Sacred Oath: Redemption

### Tenets of Redemption

The tenets of the Oath of Redemption hold a paladin to a high standard of peace and justice.

**Peace:** Violence is a weapon of last resort. Diplomacy and understanding are the paths to long-lasting peace.

**Innocence:** All people begin life in an innocent state, and it is their environment or the influence of dark forces that drives them to evil. By setting the proper example, and working to heal the wounds of a deeply flawed world, thou canst set anyone on a righteous path.

**Patience:** Change takes time. Those who have walked the path of the wicked must be given reminders to keep them honest and true. Once thou hast planted the seed of righteousness in a creature, thou must work day after day to allow it to survive and then flourish.

**Wisdom:** Thy heart and mind shalt stay clear, for eventually thou wilt be forced to admit defeat. While every creature can be redeemed, some are so far along the path of evil that thou hast no choice but to end their lives for the greater good. Any such action must be carefully weighed and the consequences fully understood, but once thou hast made the decision, thou shalt follow through with it knowing thy path is just.

## Sacred Oath: Treachery

### Tenets of Treachery

A paladin who embraces the Oath of Treachery owes allegiance to no one. There are no tenets of this oath, for it lacks any substance.

## Sacred Oath: Vengeance

### Tenets of Vengeance

The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

**Fight the Greater Evil:** Faced with a choice of fighting my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil, I choose the greater evil.

**No Mercy for the Wicked:** Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

**By Any Means Necessary:** My qualms can't get in the way of exterminating my foes.

**Restitution:** If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.
