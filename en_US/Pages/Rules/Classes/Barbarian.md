[gimmick:title](Barbarian)

# Barbarian

For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every **barbarian**, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.

## Rage (1st level)

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. A number of times per day specified in the Barbarian table, on your turn, you can **enter a rage** as a **bonus action**.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you **aren't wearing heavy armor**:

* You have advantage on **Strength checks** and **Strength saving throws**.
* When you make a **melee weapon attack** using **Strength**, you gain a **bonus to the damage roll**, as shown in the Barbarian table.
* You have **resistance** to **bludgeoning**, **piercing**, and **slashing** damage.

You **can't cast spells** or **concentrate** on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for **1 minute**. It **ends** early if you are **knocked unconscious** or if **your turn ends** and you **haven't attacked a hostile creature** since your last turn or **taken damage** since then. You can also **end your rage** on your turn as a **bonus action**.

## Unarmored Defense (1st level)

While you are **not wearing any armor**, your armor class equals **10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier**. You **can use a shield** and still gain this benefit.

## Danger Sense (2nd level)

*You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.*

You have **advantage** on **Dexterity saving throws** against **effects that you can see**, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you **can't be blinded**, **deafened**, or **incapacitated**.

## Reckless Attack (2nd level)

*You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation.* 

When you make your **first attack on your turn**, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you **advantage** on **melee weapon attack rolls** using **Strength** during this turn, but **attack rolls against you** have **advantage** until your next turn.

## Extra Attack (5th level)

You can attack **twice**, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Fast Movement (5th level)

Your speed increases by **10 feet** when you **aren't wearing heavy armor**.

## Feral Instinct (7th level)

You have **advantage** on **Initiative** rolls.

Additionally, if you are **surprised** at the beginning of combat and **aren't incapacitated**, you can **act normally** on your first turn, but **only if you enter your rage** before doing anything else on that turn.

## Brutal Critical (9th, 13th, 17th level)

You can **roll one additional weapon damage die** when determining the damage for a **critical hit** with a **melee attack**. You add that roll **at the end**, on top of the calculated total critical damage.

This increases to **two** additional dice at 13th level and **three** additional dice at 17th level.

## Relentless Rage (11th level)

*Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds.*

If you **drop to 0 hit points** while you're raging and **don't die outright**, you can **make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw**. If you **succeed**, you drop to **1 hit point** instead.

**Each time** you use this feature after the first, the **DC increases by 5**. When you finish a short or long **rest**, the **DC resets to 10**.

## Persistent Rage (15th level)

Your rage is so fierce that it ends early **only** if you **fall unconscious** or if you **choose to end it**.

## Indomitable Might (18th level)

If your **total** for a **Strength check** is **less than your Strength score**, you can **use that score** in place of the total.

## Primal Champion (20th level)

*You embody the power of the wilds.*

Your **Strength** and **Constitution** scores **increase by 4**. Your **maximum** for those scores is now **24**.

# Primal Paths

## List of Primal Paths

* **Ancestral Guardian:** Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.
* **Berserker:** For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end – that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.
* **Juggernaut:** Juggernaut barbarians are siege engines in their own right, able to stand their ground and move their foes into positions of weakness. While raging, they make any battlefield their domain, shoving foes over mountainsides and destroying even the strongest structures with their attacks.
* **Storm Herald:** Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.
* **Totem Warrior:** The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.
* **Zealot:** Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots – warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.

## Primal Path: Ancestral Guardian

### Ancestral Protectors (3rd level)

*Spectral warriors appear when you enter your rage.*

While you’re **raging**, the **first creature** on your turn you **hit with an attack** becomes the **target** of the warriors, which hinder its attacks. Until the **start of your next turn**, that **target** has **disadvantage** on **any attack roll** that **isn't against you**, and when the target **hits a creature other than you** with an **attack**, that creature has **resistance** to the damage of that attack.

### Spirit Shield (6th, 10th, 14th level)

*The guardian spirits that aid you can provide protection to those you defend.*

If you are **raging** and a creature you can see **within 30 feet** of you **takes damage**, you can use your **reaction** to **reduce** that damage by **2d6**.

When you reach certain levels in this class, you reduce the damage by more: by **3d6** at **10th level** and by **4d6** at **14th level**.

### Consult the Spirits (10th level)

**Once between rests**, you have the ability to **consult** with your ancestral spirits. When you do so, you cast the **Augury** or **Clairvoyance** spell, without using a spell slot or material components. Rather than creating a spherical sensor, this use of Clairvoyance invisibly summons one of your ancestral spirits to the chosen location. **Wisdom** is your **spellcasting ability** for these spells.

### Vengeful Ancestors (14th level)

*Your ancestral spirits grow powerful enough to retaliate.*

When you use your **Spirit Shield** to reduce the damage of an attack, the **attacker** takes an **amount of ethereal damage** equal to the **reduction** of your Spirit Shield.

---

## Primal Path: Berserker

### Frenzy (3rd level)

You can go into a **frenzy** when you **rage**. 

If you do so, for the duration of your rage you can **make a single melee weapon attack** as a **bonus action** on **each of your turns after this one**. When your **rage ends**, you suffer **one level of exhaustion**.

### Mindless Rage (6th level)

You **can't be charmed** or **frightened** while **raging**. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.

### Intimidating Presence (10th level)

You can use your **action** to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose **one creature** that you can see **within 30 feet** of you. If the creature **can see or hear you**, it must succeed on a **Wisdom saving throw** (DC equal to **8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier**) or be **frightened** of you **until the end of your next turn**. 

On subsequent turns, you can use your **action** to **extend** the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect **ends** if the creature **ends its turn out of line of sight** or **more than 60 feet away** from you.

If the creature **succeeds** on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on **that** creature again **for 24 hours**.

### Retaliation (14th level)

When you **take damage** from a creature that is **within your reach**, you can use your **reaction** to **make an opportunity attack** against that creature.

---

## Primal Path: Juggernaut

### Thunderous Blows (3rd level)

*Your rage instills you with the strength to batter around your foes, making any battlefield your domain.*

**Once per turn** while **raging**, when you **damage** a creature with a **melee attack**, you can force the target to make a **Strength saving throw** (DC **8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier**). On a **failure**, you **push the target 5 feet away** from you, and you can choose to **immediately move 5 feet** into the target’s previous position.

### Stance of the Mountain (3rd level)

*You harness your fury to anchor your feet to the earth, shrugging off the blows of those who wish to topple you.*

You **cannot** be knocked **prone** while **raging**, **unless** you become **unconscious**.

### Demolishing Might (6th level)

*You can muster destructive force with your assault, shaking the core of even the strongest structures.*

All of your **melee attacks** gain the **siege** property (your attacks deal double damage to objects and structures). Your **melee attacks** against creatures of the **construct** type deal an **additional 1d8 weapon damage**.

### Overwhelming Cleave (10th level)

*You wade into armies of foes, great swings of your weapon striking many of those who threaten you.*

When you **make a weapon attack** while **raging**, you can **make another attack** as a **bonus action** with the **same weapon** against a **different** creature that is **within 5 feet of the original target** and **within reach** of your weapon.

### Unstoppable (14th level)

You can choose to become **unstoppable** when you enter a **rage**. If you do so, for the duration of the rage your **speed cannot be reduced**, and you are **immune** to the **dazed**, **fear**, **paralyzed**, **slowed** and **stunned** conditions. If you are affected by any of these conditions, you can **still take your bonus action** to enter your **rage** and **suspend** the effects for the duration of the rage. When your **rage ends**, you suffer **one level of exhaustion**.

---

## Primal Path: Storm Herald

### Storm Aura (3rd level)

You emanate a stormy, magical aura while you **rage**. The aura extends **10 feet** from you in every direction, but not through total cover.

Your aura has an effect that activates when you **enter your rage**, and you can activate the effect **again** on **each of your turns** as a **bonus action**. Choose **desert**, **sea**, or **tundra**. Your aura's effect depends on that chosen environment, as detailed below. You can change your environment choice whenever you gain a level in this class.

If your aura's effects require a saving throw, the **DC** equals **8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier**.

| Environment | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Desert**  | When this effect is activated, **all other creatures** in your aura take **2 fire damage each**. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to **3** at **5th level**, **4** at **10th level**, **5** at **15th level**, and **6** at **20th level**. |
| **Sea**     | When this effect is activated, you can choose **one other creature** you can see **in your aura**. The target must make a **Dexterity saving throw**. The target takes **1d6 lightning damage** on a **failed save**, or **half** as much damage on a **successful** one. The damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to **2d6** at **10th** level, **3d6** at **15th level**, and **4d6** at **20th level**. |
| **Tundra**  | When this effect is activated, **each** creature of your choice **in your aura** gains **2 temporary hit points**, as icy spirits inure it to suffering. The temporary hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to **3** at **5th level**, **4** at **10th level**, **5** at **15th level**, and **6** at **20th level**. |

### Storm Soul (6th level)

The storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

| Environment | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Desert**  | You gain **resistance** to **fire** damage, and you **don’t suffer** the effects of **extreme heat**. Moreover, as an **action**, you can **touch a flammable object** that **isn't being worn or carried** by anyone else and **set it on fire**. |
| **Sea**     | You gain **resistance** to **lightning** damage, and you **can breathe underwater**. You also gain a **swimming speed of 30 feet**. |

### Shielding Storm (10th level)

*You learn to use your mastery of the storm to protect others.*

Each creature of your choice has the **damage resistance** you gained from the **Storm Soul** feature **while** the creature is **in your Storm Aura**.

### Raging Storm (14th level)

*The power of the storm you channel grows mightier, lashing out at your foes.*

The effect is based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.

| Environment | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Desert**  | Immediately after a creature **in your aura** **hits you with an attack**, you can use your **reaction** to force that creature to make a **Dexterity saving throw**. On a **failed** save, the creature takes **fire damage** equal to your **Barbarian level**. |
| **Sea**     | When you **hit a creature in your aura** with an **attack**, you can use your **reaction** to force that creature to make a **Strength saving throw**. On a **failed** save, the creature is **knocked prone**, as if struck by a wave. |
| **Tundra**  | Whenever the effect of your **Storm Aura** is **activated**, you can choose **one creature** you can see **in the aura**. That creature must succeed on a **Strength saving throw**, or its **speed is reduced to 0** until the **start of your next turn**, as magical frost covers it. |

## Primal Path: Totem Warrior

### Spirit Seeker (3rd level)

You gain the ability to cast the **Beast Sense** and **Speak with Animals** spells, but **only as rituals**.

You choose a **totem spirit** and gain its feature. You must **make** or **acquire** a **physical totem object** – an amulet or similar adornment – that incorporates fur or feathers, claws, teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.

Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more appropriate to your homeland. For example, you could choose a hawk or vulture in place of an eagle.

| Totem Spirit | Effect                                                       |

| **Eagle**    | *You gain the eyesight of an eagle.* You can see **up to 1 mile away** with **no difficulty**, able to discern **even fine details** as though looking at something **no more than 100 feet away** from you. Additionally, **dim light doesn't impose disadvantage** on your **Perception** checks. |
| **Elk**      | *The elk spirit helps you roam far and fast.* Whether mounted or on foot, your **travel pace is doubled**, as is the **travel pace of up to ten companions** while they're **within 60 feet of you** and **you're not incapacitated**. |

### Spirit Walker (10th level)

You can cast the **Commune with Nature** spell, but **only as a ritual**. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose for your features appears to you to convey the information you seek.

### Totemic Attunement (14th level)

You gain a magical benefit based on the totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same animal you've selected for a previous feature or a different one.

| Totem Spirit | Effect                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bear**     | While you're **raging**, any creature **within your reach** that's **hostile** to you has **disadvantage** on **attack** rolls against **targets other than you** or another character with this feature.

## Primal Path: Zealot

### Divine Fury (3rd level)

*You can channel divine fury into your weapon strikes.*

While you're **raging**, the **first creature you hit** on **each of your turns** with a **weapon attack** takes **extra damage** equal to **1d6 + half your Barbarian level**. The extra damage is **necrotic** or **radiant**; you choose the type of damage when you gain this feature.

### Warrior of the Gods (3rd level)

*Your soul is marked for endless battle.*

If a spell, such as Raise Dead, has the sole effect of **restoring you to life** (but not undeath), the caster **doesn't need material components** to cast the spell on you.

### Fanatical Focus (6th level)

*You learn to channel divine power to inspire zealotry in others.*

**Once per day**, as a **bonus action**, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. **Up to ten other creatures** of your choice **within 60 feet** of you that **can hear you** gain **advantage** on **attack rolls** and **saving throws** until the **start of your next turn**.

### Rage Beyond Death (14th level)

*The divine power that fuels your rage allows you to shrug off fatal blows.*

While you're **raging**, having **0 hit points** doesn’t knock you **unconscious**. You **still** must **make death saving throws**, and you **suffer the normal effects** of taking damage while at 0 hit points. However, if you would **die** due to failing **death saving throws**, you **don’t die until your rage ends**, and you **die** then **only if you still have 0 hit points**.
