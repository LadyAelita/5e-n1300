[gimmick:title](Advantage and Disadvantage)

# Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability, a spell, or the GM, tells you that you have **advantage** or **disadvantage** on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. 

When that happens, you **roll a second d20** when you make the roll. Use the **higher** of the two rolls if you have **advantage**, and use the **lower** roll if you have **disadvantage**. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

## Stacking

Advantage/disadvantage **doesn't stack**.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you **don't roll more than one additional d20**. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

## Canceling out

If circumstances cause a roll to have **both advantage and disadvantage**, you are considered to have **neither of them**, and you **roll one d20 as per usual**. 

This is true **even** if the number of advantages **is not equal** to the number of disadvantages (as in, **one is greater** than the other). In such a situation, you **still** have **neither** advantage nor disadvantage.
