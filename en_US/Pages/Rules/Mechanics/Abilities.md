[gimmick:title](Abilities)

# Abilities

There exist six **abilities**:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power,
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility,
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance,
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory,
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight,
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality.

Each of a creature's abilities has a **score**, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a **modifier**, derived from the score and ranging from **-5** (for an ability score of 1) to **+10** (for a score of 30). A modifier is equal to **(score - 10) / 2, rounded down**. Modifiers are added to corresponding ability checks, saving throws and attack rolls made with weapons that use the related ability.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | -5       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 10-11 | +0       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 20-21 | +5       |
| 22-23 | +6       |
| 24-25 | +7       |
| 26-27 | +8       |
| 28-29 | +9       |
| 30    | +10      |

## Strength

**Strength** measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

**Strength** directly influences **carrying capacity** and **attack** and **damage** rolls made with either **no weapon**, a **non-finesse melee weapon**, or a **ranged thrown non-finesse weapon**.

Your **carrying capacity** is **15 times Strength score**. This is the maximum amount of weight (in pounds) that you can carry at all. However, you can only carry up to **5 times Strength score** without any penalties. If you carry weight in excess of that amount, you are **encumbered** and your **speed drops by 10 feet**. If you carry weight in excess of **10 times Strength score**, you are **heavily encumbered** - your **speed drops by 20 feet** and you have **disadvantage** on **all checks** that use **Strength**, **Dexterity** or **Constitution**.

You can **push**, **drag** or **lift** a weight in pounds up to **30 times Strength score**. While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

The above rules are for **Medium** and **Small** creatures. **Larger** creatures can **bear more** weight and **smaller** creatures can carry **less**.

| Size                  | Encumbrance threshold | Heavy encumbrance threshold | Carrying capacity  | Push, drag or lift capacity |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- |
| **Tiny**              | 2.5 times Strength    | 5 times Strength            | 7.5 times Strength | 15 times Strength           |
| **Small**, **Medium** | 5 times Strength      | 10 times Strength           | 15 times Strength  | 30 times Strength           |
| **Large**             | 10 times Strength     | 20 times Strength           | 30 times Strength  | 60 times Strength           |
| **Huge**              | 20 times Strength     | 40 times Strength           | 60 times Strength  | 120 times Strength          |
| **Gargantuan**        | 40 times Strength     | 80 times Strength           | 120 times Strength | 240 times Strength          |

A **Strength** check can model any attempt to **lift**, **push**, **pull**, or **break** something, to **force** your body **through a space**, or to otherwise **apply brute force** to a situation. Examples of tasks that call for a Strength check include:

* Forcing open a door
* Breaking free of bonds
* Pushing through a tunnel that's too small
* Hanging on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
* Tipping over a statue
* Keeping a boulder from rolling
* Preventing a damaged tree from falling over

The following **skills** are modified by **Strength**:

* Athletics

## Dexterity

**Dexterity** measures agility, reflexes, balance and precision.

**Dexterity** directly influences **armor class**, **initiative** and **attack** and **damage** rolls made with a **finesse melee weapon**, a **ranged non-thrown weapon** or a **ranged thrown finesse weapon**.

Depending on the **armor** you wear, you might add **all**, **some** or **none** of your **Dexterity modifier** to your **Armor Class**. Generally, **light armor** lets you add **all** of your Dexterity modifier, **medium armor** allows you to add **up to +2** and **heavy armor** makes it so that Dexterity modifier **does not count** at all toward your AC, regardless if it's positive or negative.

A **Dexterity** check can model any attempt to execute a task that requires **precision** or to **keep from falling** on tricky footing. Examples of tasks that call for a Dexterity check include:

* Controlling a heavily laden cart on a steep descent
* Securely tying up a prisoner
* Wriggling free of bonds
* Playing a stringed instrument
* Crafting a small or detailed object

The following **skills** are modified by **Dexterity**:

* Acrobatics
* Disabling Devices
* Sleight of Hand
* Stealth

## Constitution

**Constitution** measures health, stamina, and vital force.

**Constitution** directly contributes to your **hit points** and influences **death** saves and **spell concentration** saves.

**Constitution** checks are uncommon, because the endurance this ability represents is largely **passive** rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to **push beyond** normal limits, however. Examples of tasks that call for a Constitution check include:

* Holding your breath
* Marching or working for hours without rest
* Going without sleep
* Surviving without food or water
* Drinking an entire stein of ale in one go

There are **no skills** modified by **Constitution**.

## Intelligence

**Intelligence** measures mental acuity, cunningness, conscious knowledge, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.

**Intelligence** directly contributes to the number of **skill proficiencies** you have. **Wizards** also use Intelligence as their **spellcasting ability**.

An **Intelligence** check comes into play when you need to draw on **logic**, **education**, **memory**, or **deductive reasoning**. Examples of tasks that call for an Intelligence check include:

* Communicating with a creature without using words
* Estimating the value of an item
* Pulling together a disguise to pass as a city guard
* Forging a document
* Recalling lore or events from the past
* Winning a game of skill
* Solving a differential equation

The following **skills** are modified by **Intelligence**:

* Arcana
* Craftsmanship
* History
* Investigation*
* Medicine
* Nature
* Politics
* Religion
* Runic Engineering
* Warcraft

<sup>\* **Investigation** is the **only** Intelligence-based skill that is **not** considered a **knowledge** skill.</sup>

## Wisdom

**Wisdom** reflects **how attuned** you are **to the world around** you and represents **perceptiveness**, **common sense**, **subconscious knowledge**, **foresight** and **intuition**. It also serves as a measure of your **sanity**.

**Clerics**, **Druids** and **Rangers** use **Wisdom** as their **spellcasting ability**.

A **Wisdom** check might reflect an effort to utilize your **intuition** or **subconscious knowledge**. Examples of tasks that call for a Wisdom check include:

* Getting a gut feeling about what course of action to follow
* Discerning whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

The following **skills** are modified by **Wisdom**:

* Animal Handling
* Composure
* Insight
* Perception
* Survival

## Charisma

**Charisma** measures your ability to **lead** and **interact** effectively with others. It includes such factors as **confidence** and **eloquence**, and it can symbolize a **charming** or **commanding personality**. It represents **charm**, **force of personality**, **force of will**, **zeal** and **courage**.

**Bards**, **Paladins**, **Sorcerers** and **Warlocks** use **Charisma** as their **spellcasting ability**. Charisma is also frequently used in various systems as a measure of **leadership**.

A **Charisma** check might arise when you are navigating a **tricky social situation**. Flat Charisma checks are rare, given how most situations are covered by the skills related to this ability.

The following **skills** are modified by **Charisma**:

* Deception
* Hearsay
* Intimidation
* Performance
* Persuasion

## Ability score saps

Your ability scores might get **sapped**, meaning they are simply reduced. The **modifier** for that ability is then reduced along with them, meaning all values depending on that modifier need to be changed accordingly.

There exist **temporary** and **permanent** saps. **Temporary** saps generally either **decay** or **completely go away** on a **long rest**, but the GM might choose otherwise. You might not know in advance when a temporary sap will end until that occurs. **Permanent** saps modify your ability score **forever** and cannot be reverted except for using very powerful magic, such as the Wish spell.

When your **Constitution** gets sapped, **both** your current and maximum hit points are decreased as a result.

Losing **Intelligence** is an **exception** in that you **don't lose your base proficiencies** you've previously acquired thanks to that modifier.

### Other consequences

While any ability loss is undesirable, going **below** the threshold of **8** will bear additional consequences, depending on how low the score was reduced, with going down to **0** being the most debilitating.

The below table describes the result of an ability score going down below 8 for each individual ability. Those repercussions are just general descriptions and examples, the exact effect is ultimately up to the GM. Some class features, spells or other special effects might explicitly cause other effects by sapping abilities. For instance, losing **Wisdom** as a result of using **dread magic** would **corrupt** the character, slowly turning them evil.

| Score | Strength                                                     | Dexterity                                                    | Constitution                                                 | Intelligence                                                 | Wisdom                                                       | Charisma                                                     |

## No ability score

Having **no ability score** is **different** from having an ability score of **0**. Some creatures lack certain ability scores whatsoever. For example, Ghosts are completely incorporeal and thus don't have Strength or Constitution.

A creature **cannot** make checks related to abilities they don't have. In case of **saving throws**, they either fail them **automatically** (such as a creature that has no Dexterity as a result of being immobile), or they just **don't have to** make them, **avoiding** all related effects anyway (such as an incorporeal creature with no Constitution, given how it couldn't potentially be physically affected by many effects).

If a creature needs to use an ability score or modifier in order to calculate another value that they use, it will generally use a different ability instead. For example, many incorporeal undead will use Charisma instead of Constitution for calculating hit points.
