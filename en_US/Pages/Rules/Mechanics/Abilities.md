[gimmick:title](Abilities)

# Abilities

There exist six **abilities**:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power,
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility,
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance,
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory,
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight,
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality.

Each of a creature's abilities has a **score**, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a **modifier**, derived from the score and ranging from **-5** (for an ability score of 1) to **+10** (for a score of 30). A modifier is equal to **(score - 10) / 2, rounded down**. Modifiers are added to corresponding ability checks, saving throws and attack rolls made with weapons that use the related ability.

| Score | Modifier |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | -5       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 10-11 | +0       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 20-21 | +5       |
| 22-23 | +6       |
| 24-25 | +7       |
| 26-27 | +8       |
| 28-29 | +9       |
| 30    | +10      |

## Ability score saps

Your ability scores might get **sapped**, meaning they are simply reduced. The **modifier** for that ability is then reduced along with them, meaning all values depending on that modifier need to be changed accordingly.

There exist **temporary** and **permanent** saps. **Temporary** saps generally either **decay** or **completely go away** on a **long rest**, but the GM might choose otherwise. You might not know in advance when a temporary sap will end until that occurs. **Permanent** saps modify your ability score **forever** and cannot be reverted except for using very powerful magic, such as the Wish spell.

When your **Constitution** gets sapped, **both** your current and maximum hit points are decreased as a result.

Losing **Intelligence** is an **exception** in that you **don't lose your base proficiencies** you've previously acquired thanks to that modifier.

### Other consequences

While any ability loss is undesirable, going **below** the threshold of **8** will bear additional consequences, depending on how low the score was reduced, with going down to **0** being the most debilitating.

The below table describes the result of an ability score going down below 8 for each individual ability. Those repecussions are just general descriptions and examples, the exact effect is ultimately up to the GM. Some class features, spells or other special effects might explicitly cause other effects by sapping abilities. For instance, losing **Wisdom** as a result of using **dread magic** would **corrupt** the character, slowly turning them evil.

| Score | Strength                                                     | Dexterity                                                    | Constitution                                                 | Intelligence                                                 | Wisdom                                                       | Charisma                                                     |

## No ability score

Having **no ability score** is **different** from having an ability score of **0**. Some creatures lack certain ability scores whatsoever. For example, Ghosts are completely incorporeal and thus don't have Strength or Constitution.

A creature **cannot** make checks related to abilities they don't have. In case of **saving throws**, they either fail them **automatically** (such as a creature that has no Dexterity as a result of being immobile), or they just **don't have to** make them, **avoiding** all related effects anyway (such as an incorporeal creature with no Constitution, given how it couldn't potentially be physically affected by many effects).

If a creature needs to use an ability score or modifier in order to calculate another value that they use, it will generally use a different ability instead. For example, many incorporeal undead will use Charisma instead of Constitution for calculating hit points.
