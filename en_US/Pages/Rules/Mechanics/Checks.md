# Checks

A **check** tests a character's ability to do or avoid something successfully. It consists of a **d20** roll compared against a specified number, called **Difficulty Class (DC)**. If the result is **greater than or equal** to the **DC**, the check succeeds, otherwise it fails.

There exist **three** main types of checks - **attack rolls** (where the DC is the target's Armor Class), **ability checks** and **saving throws**.

There are as many **saving throws** as there are **abilities** in the game. Dexterity, Constitution and Wisdom are considered the primary saves, while Strength, Intelligence and Charisma are considered secondary.

## Skill checks

**Skill check** is a type of an **ability check** that, in addition to using the modifier of the related ability, is also modified by various modifiers assigned to the related skill. For example, an Acrobatics check is a skill check, but also an ability check, namely a Dexterity check.

## Contesting checks

Some situations might call for a **contesting check**, which sees the **DC** of a check being determined with **another check**, made by the **opposing side**, instead of being a predetermined number.

## Natural 1 and 20

Regardless of the modifiers and the DC, rolling a **1** on the **d20** is always a **failure**, while rolling a **20** on the **d20** is always a **success**.

For some checks, such as an attack roll or ability checks in certain circumstances, a **natural 20** might represent a **critical success**, which is an even higher degree of success than expected. Similarly, **natural 1** might represent an embarassing **critical failure**.

**Note:** While a **critical success** on an **attack** roll increases the damage dealt, a critical **failure** on a **saving throw** does not increase the damage taken.
