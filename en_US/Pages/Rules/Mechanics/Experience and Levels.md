[gimmick:title](Experience and Levels)

# Experience and Levels

As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by **experience points**. A character who **reaches** a specified **experience point total** advances in capability. This advancement is called **gaining a level**.

Your **total level** is the sum of your levels in each class. For example, if you have 4 Fighter levels and 3 Wizard levels, your total level is 7.

| Level  | Experience points | Proficiency bonus |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **1**  | 0                 | **+2 (increase)** |
| **2**  | 300               | +2                |
| **3**  | 900               | +2                |
| **4**  | 2,700             | +2                |
| **5**  | 6,500             | **+3 (increase)** |
| **6**  | 14,000            | +3                |
| **7**  | 23,000            | +3                |
| **8**  | 34,000            | +3                |
| **9**  | 48,000            | **+4 (increase)** |
| **10** | 64,000            | +4                |
| **11** | 85,000            | +4                |
| **12** | 100,000           | +4                |
| **13** | 120,000           | **+5 (increase)** |
| **14** | 140,000           | +5                |
| **15** | 165,000           | +5                |
| **16** | 195,000           | +5                |
| **17** | 225,000           | **+6 (increase)** |
| **18** | 265,000           | +6                |
| **19** | 305,000           | +6                |
| **20** | 355,000           | +6                |

**Note:** **Proficiency bonus** can also be calculated as **1 + level / 4**, rounded up.

## Benefits of gaining a level

* Each time you gain a level, you gain **1 additional Hit Die**. Thus, the **number of Hit Dice** you have is equal to **your total level**.
* Your **hit point maximum** is increased by **the higher average of the Hit Die you've gained + your Constitution modifier**. For example, if your Constitution modifier is +3 and you gain a Fighter level, the die you've gained is d10, the higher average of which is 6. Therefore, your HP maximum is increased by 9.
* You potentially gain **class features** for the newly acquired level, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features might be **Ability Score Increases**. Each Ability Score Increase allows you to either:
  * increase **one ability score** by **2**,
  * increase **two different ability scores** by **1**,
  * gain **a feat**, which is an additional special feature you select from the list of feats.
* If your **Constitution modifier** has **increased** by **1**, your **hit point maximum** increases by **your total level**.
* Your **Proficiency bonus** potentially increases by **1**.

## Multiclassing

When gaining a level, you might choose to gain a level in a **different class** instead of the one you've had up to that point, so that you have levels in multiple classes. However, if you opt to take levels in a class you don't currently have any levels in, you must first gain **one empty level** as a penalty.

An **empty level** is a level that gives you **no benefits** and **doesn't count toward your total level**, but is **taken into account** when **determining** the number of expierence points needed to **level up**.

**Note:** If you multiclass, you are effectively **behind the rest of the party** by the **number of levels** equal to the **number of classes you have past your first class**.

When you multiclass into a class, you need to meet the **requirements** for that class, as per the table below.

| Class         | Requirement                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Barbarian** | Strength 13                     |
| **Bard**      | Charisma 13                     |
| **Cleric**    | Wisdom 13                       |
| **Druid**     | Wisdom 13                       |
| **Fighter**   | Strength 13 **or** Dexterity 13 |
| **Monk**      | Dexterity 13 **and** Wisdom 13  |
| **Paladin**   | Strength 13 **and** Charisma 13 |
| **Ranger**    | Dexterity 13 **and** Wisdom 13  |
| **Rogue**     | Dexterity 13                    |
| **Sorcerer**  | Charisma 13                     |
| **Warlock**   | Charisma 13                     |
| **Wizard**    | Intelligence 13                 |

### Multiclassing and class features

Some of the features, listed below, have additional rules for when you gain access to them from two different classes.

#### Channel Divinity

If you already have the **Channel Divinity** feature and gain a level in a class that **also** grants the feature, you **gain** the Channel Divinity **effects** granted by **that class**, but getting the feature again **doesn't give you an additional use** of it.

You **gain additional uses only** when you reach a class level that **explicitly** grants them to you.

For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from either of your two classes.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the **Extra Attack** class feature or a feature that grants similar benefits from more than one class, the features from different classes **don't add** together - you get to choose which **single class** to consider in such a scenario.

#### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the **Unarmored Defense** feature, you **can't gain it again** from another class.

### Multiclassing and spellcasting

Once you have the **Spellcasting** feature from **more than one class**, use the **rules below**.

If you multiclass but have the Spellcasting feature from **only one class**, you follow the rules as described **in that class**.

#### Spells known and prepared

You determine what spells you know and can prepare **for each class individually**, as if you were a **single-classed member** of that class.

**Each spell** you know and prepare is **associated** with one of your classes, and you use the **spellcasting ability** of **that class** when you cast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting **focus**, such as a holy symbol, can be used **only** for the spells from the **class associated with that focus**.

#### Spell slots

To determine your **spellcaster level**:

* add together all your levels in **full caster** classes (bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer and wizard),
* add **half** your levels (rounded down) in **half-caster** classes (paladin and ranger),
* add **one third** of your levels (rounded down) in **third-caster** classes, such as fighter (eldritch knight) or rogue (arcane trickster).

You can then use the acquired spellcaster level to determine the spell slots you have by consluting the table below.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is **higher** than the **spells you know or can prepare**. You can **use** those slots, but **only to cast your lower-level spells**. If a lower-level spell that you cast has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.

If you have both the **Spellcasting** class feature and the **Pact Magic** class feature from the warlock class, you can freely use **spell slots** gained from **either** of those features to cast **spells acquired** from **either** one.

Similarly, if you have both the **Spellcasting** class feature and the **Mystic Arcanum** class feature from the warlock class, you can also freely use **spell slots** gained from **either** of those features to cast **spells acquired** from **either** one.

## Calculating health

In some cases, it's simpler to just **recalculate** your **hit point maximum** from scratch after gaining a level, to ensure no mistakes have been made. Do this only after making all the choices you have to make regarding the newly attained level, such as which ability scores to increase.

The exact method of doing so might be **different** for **multiclass** and **single class** characters, namely in case there are **multiple different hit dice** among those used by your classes.

A **multiclass** character, whose **all classes** have **the same hit die**, can be treated as a **single class** character for purposes of calculating health.

| Hit Die | Maximum | Higher Average | Classes                                   |
| ------- | ------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **d12** | 12      | 7              | Barbarian                                 |
| **d10** | 10      | 6              | Fighter, Paladin, Ranger                  |
| **d8**  | 8       | 5              | Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, Warlock |
| **d6**  | 6       | 4              | Sorcerer, Wizard                          |

**Note:** Bear in mind that there might exist some class (or subclass) features that change the hit die you use for that class.

### Single class characters

For a single class character, **max HP** = **hit die max** - **hit die higher average** + **total level** times (**Constitution modifier** + **hit die higher average**).

For example, if you are an 8th level Fighter with a +3 Constitution modifier, your max HP = 10 - 6 + 8 x (3 + 6) = 4 + 8 x 9 = 4 + 72 = 76.

### Multiclass characters

1. For each class you have levels in, given the **hit die** of **that class**, find a value **X**, where **X** = **number of levels in that class** times (**Constitution modifier** + **hit die higher average**).
2. Then, **sum all the X values** you've calculated.
3. Determine which class you've picked at **1st level**. Add the **hit die max** of that class to the total. Then subtract the **hit die higher average** of that class from the total.
4. Now the total is equal to your **hit point maximum**.

**Hint:** To potentially speed up the calculations, you can bundle classes that use the same hit die together, treating them as one and summing their levels. You will seldom have levles in that many different classes, though.
