# Languages

There exist **four levels** of **language proficiency**, each level determining a character's command of the given language. Moreover, each level unlocks the ability to use and create higher orders of **spell scrolls** written in that language, as long as you meet the other requirements.

## Language proficiency levels

### None

You don't know the language at all and cannot read nor write any magic scrolls written in that language.

### 1st: Basic

You know the most common phrases in the language, such as greeting somebody, asking about their place of origin, or communicating that you do not speak the given language. However, trying to translate sentences you haven't previously memorized is still close to impossible for you. If there exists a unique alphabet for the language, you know it, but sporadically you might need a double take to figure out certain letters. You can **read magic scrolls** with spells up to the **2nd order**, but you still **can't write scrolls** of your own.

### 2nd: Passable

You know the most of the common words in the language and you're able to construct sentences that, despite frequently being grammatically incorrect, are understandable to most of the native speakers. You have a very heavy accent and quite often mispronounce words. You also tend to forget words, which causes you to take long breaks in sentences. If the language has a unique alphabet, you know it almost perfectly, but writing anything requires extended time for you and you're prone to making spelling mistakes. You can **read magic scrolls** with spells up to the **5th order**, but you still **can't write scrolls** of your own.

### 3rd: Fluent

Aside from a middling to barely noticeable accent, you use the language as if you were a native speaker. You can read perfectly well and, if given enough time, you're decent-to-good at writing, even if it's still an exhausting process for you. You can **read magic scrolls** with spells up to the **8th order** and can **write scrolls** of your own up to the **2nd order**.

### 4th: Linguist

You've mastered the language on a meta level, beyond regular communication purposes. You have comprehended every detail of the language's grammatical structures and you know the language's history. You can **read all magic scrolls** and can **write magic scrolls of any order**.

## Using and creating magic scrolls

Language alone isn't enough to be able to use or create scrolls that contain spells.

To **use** magic scrolls, you must first have a high enough language proficiency level to allow you to **read** the scroll with a spell of that order. Then, you must also either **have spell slots** or be proficient in **Arcana** (for **arcane** magic scrolls) or **Religion** (for **divine** magic scrolls).

To **create** magic scrolls, you must have a high enough language proficiency level to allow you to **write** the scroll, and you must also **know** the spell you're writing. Moreover, you can only write scrolls of spell orders for which you have spell slots.

Writing a magic scroll takes a **number of hours** equal to the **spell's order** (30 minutes for cantrips). It also requires you to prepare special ink, by mixing it with gemdust. The gemdust must be from a gem representing the element of the spell that's being written down. Moreover, you might add material components that the spell uses (if any) to the ink mixture, regardless of whether the specific component would be consumed by the spell or not. Any material components not added to the ink will have to be provided separately in order to cast the spell from the scroll. Additionally, after writing a **9th order scroll**, you must wait at least **7 days** until you can write another 9th order scroll.

| Spell order | How many gp worth of gemdust |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cantrip     | 5                            |
| 1st         | 10                           |
| 2nd         | 40                           |
| 3rd         | 100                          |
| 4th         | 180                          |
| 5th         | 300                          |
| 6th         | 430                          |
| 7th         | 600                          |
| 8th         | 780                          |
| 9th         | 1000                         |

Every magic scroll uses the spell DC (and other statistics, if required) of its author rather than the person using it.
