[gimmick:title](Proficiency and Expertise)

# Proficiency and Expertise

Characters have a **proficiency bonus** determined by **level**. It's equal to **1 + level / 4**, rounded up. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus might be used for various **checks** - ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

If you are **proficient** in a skill, a weapon or a saving throw related to a particular ability, you **add your proficiency bonus** to the result of the related checks. If you have **expertise** in a skill, a weapon or a saving throw, you add **twice your proficiency bonus** instead.

If you are **proficient** in a type of **armor**, you can use that type of armor properly. Otherwise, when you're **wearing armor** you're **not proficient** with, you have **disadvantage** on **all** checks (attack rolls, ability checks and saving throws) that use **Strength** or **Dexterity**, and you **cannot cast spells**.

## Gaining proficiency

You can gain proficiency (or even expertise) in **skills** through various class features and feats.

Based on your **class** and your **Intelligence** modifier, you have a **base** number of **skill** proficiencies of your choice. If your Intelligence modifier increases at any point, you **do** gain additional proficiencies accordingly.

| Base skill proficiencies  | Classes                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 6 + Intelligence modifier | Rogue                                     |
| 5 + Intelligence modifier | Bard, Ranger                              |
| 4 + Intelligence modifier | Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock          |
| 3 + Intelligence modifier | Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Wizard |

Your **weapon**, **armor** and **saving throw** proficiencies are determined by your **class** during **character creation**. You can gain additional ones through **feats** or, in some cases, **multiclassing**.

Each class is proficient in exactly **two saving throws**.
