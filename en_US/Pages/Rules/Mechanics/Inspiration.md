# Inspiration

**Inspiration** is a rule the game master can use to reward you for **playing your character in a way thatâ€™s true** to his or her **personality traits**, **ideals**, **bonds** or **flaws**. By spending your inspiration, you can get a benefit. For example, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.

Your GM can choose to give you **inspiration** for a variety of reasons. 

Typically, GMs award it when you **play out** your **personality traits**, **give in to the drawbacks** presented by a **flaw** or **bond**, and otherwise **portray your character in a compelling way**.

You **can only have up to two** tokens of inspiration at the same time. You **can only spend one at a time**. 

You cannot delay the reward you get for spending the inspiration - it takes place instantly.

## Ways to spend inspiration

* **Get advantage** on **a check you make**.
* **Impose disadvantage** on **a check the enemy makes**.
* Make **an additional attack** as part of the **attack action** (in other words, get a +1 multiattack until the end of the current turn).
* Cast **an additional spell** as part of the **cast spell action**. The spell you cast bypasses the restriction of only one non-cantrip spell per turn.
* Instead of going down (either **unconscious**, **battered** or **dying**) you **stay at 1 HP**. You might still fall **prone** by the GM's decision.
