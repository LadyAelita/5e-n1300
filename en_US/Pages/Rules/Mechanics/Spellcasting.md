# Spellcasting

## Acquiring spells

Different classes have different ways of gaining access to spells. Depending on the class, you must either **learn** the spell, **prepare** it, or **both**.

## Casting a spell

Casting spells is usually an **action**, but not always, as many spells have a different casting time specified. Aside from sacrificing your action economy resources, you must also expend a spellcasting resource, usually in the form of a **spell slot**, which must be of **the same or higher level (order)** as the order of the spell that you're casting. Moreover, you must satisfy **all** of the **components** of the spell.

If all requirements are met, the effect of the spell takes place.

## Spellcasting feature table

Classes that provide a spellcasting feature, have the feature described in tabular form, listing a variety of properties.

### Spellcasting ability

Each spellcasting class has a **single ability** assigned to it, called your **spellcasting ability**. It's the ability that you use whenever a reference to it is made elsewhere in the rules. For example, the DC of saving throws against your spells and your spell attack bonus are modified by your spellcasting ability modifier. Some spells might use your spellcasting ability modifier in the description, changing the potency of the spell depending on said modifier.

### Spell DC

Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The **DC** to resist a spell you've cast equals **8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus**.

#### Partial saves

Certain spells have a section of their description tagged as **partial save**. This section describes the effect of the spell if the **saving throw** is **successful**, but the difference between the result of the **saving throw** and the **spell DC** is **less than 5**. This effect is generally stronger than what would have taken place on a fully successful saving throw, but weaker than what would have occured on a failed save.

If the spell doesn't specify any partial save effects, it means that the partial save mechanic does not apply for that specific spell.

### Spell attack bonus

Another way a spell might determine it's success is with an **attack roll** as part of casting the spell, in place of the saving throw. Such an attack is called a **spell attack**, and it works as any other attack you would have made.

Your **attack bonus** for **spell attacks** is equal to **your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus**.

**Note:** Even though the spell attack is modified by your spellcasting ability, you **don't add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage** of the attack unless its description explicitly says so.

#### Spells that amplify attacks

Certain spells might have you make an attack that's **not a spell attack** as part of the spell, such as a melee weapon attack. In this case, you use your regular modifiers, as if you had attempted a regular attack with your weapon. The effects of the spell are then applied in addition to any damage dealt by the weapon itself.

### Spellcasting focus

A **spellcasting focus** is an item that you must have on your person in order to satisfy the **focus (F) component** of your spells as required. Different classes might allow for different types of spellcasting focuses, and the DM might allow focus options from even further beyond that selection.

### Spellcasting resource

A spellcasting resource is expended whenever you cast spells, effectively limiting the number of spells you can cast within the given time interval. The most common type of spellcasting resource is a **regular spell slot**. Such spell slots are regained on a long rest and are acquired as per your spellcasting class' level progression table.

Having any positive number of spell slots of a given order, by virtue of leveling a specific class, is usually the condition for being able to learn or prepare spells of that order from that class' spell list.

### Cantrips

**Cantrips** are spells of the **zeroth order**. They can be cast without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Cantrips are acquired separately from the proper spells of 1st or higher order, as per the class' level progression table. However, not every spellcasting class has access to cantrips.

Contary to proper spells, cantrips don't require extended resources in order to achieve more powerful effects, instead scaling directly and automatically with your level in the spellcasting class.

### Learning spells

Characters of certain classes do not have to learn spells - they instead know all the spells of all the orders for which they have spell slots of that given class. However, many classes still require one to learn a spell first. Spells are learned during level-up, providing you with the exact number of spells to meet the total number of spells known, as per the class' level progression table. Some classes implement unique mechanics to alter that process, such as the Wizard's spellbook, or an ability to forget an already known spell in return for learning a different one in its stead.

### Preparing spells

Most spellcasters must **prepare** spells during long rest, only being able to cast those spells that they had prepared, until they change their selection through simply preparing a different set of spells on the next opportunity to do so. The number of spells that you can have prepared at the same time is often based on your level in that class and your spellcasting ability modifier.

However, there exist exceptions, as some classes give you access to all spells, as long as your character knows them.

## Targeting with spells

The description of a spell specifies in detail who or what qualifies as valid targets for the spell, and how each target is affected by it.

Most spells require you to see the target, but this isn't bound to always be the case. However, regardless of the absence of that requirement, you **can never target** anything that **has total cover** with a spell, unless the description explicitly says otherwise.

The DM might rule that the way the spell manifests itself can cause potentially disruptive interactions with various elements of the environment, or that it might be tougher or even impossible to cast a specific spell in a specific situation.

### Areas of Effect

Certain spells can affect an entire area instead of a specific number of targets. Such spells quite often target **points** or **the caster** instead of those whom it will actually affect, but that isn't always the case.

## Concentration

Some spells require you to **maintain concentration** (or give you an option to do so) in order to keep their effects in play. Such spells **end** once the duration given in the spell's description has passed, but in addition to that, they can also immediately **end** at any given moment before that - namely when the caster's **concentration** is **broken**.

### Maintaining concentration

In order to **maintain** concentration on a spell that you have cast, you don't need to take any specific actions, other than trying to avoid situations that can potentially **break** your concentration. Maintaining concentration **does not interfere** with any other actions, such as moving, attacking or even casting other spells, as long as they don't require concentration.

You can only keep concentrating on **one concentration spell at a time**.

### Breaking concentration

There exist a few ways of causing a spellcaster to **lose** their **concentration**.

* A spellcaster might **voluntarily end their concentration** at any time, no action required.
* Whenever you cast a **concentration spell**, while **already concentrating** on another spell, you **lose concentration** on the current spell in favor of the more recently cast one, given how you can only concentrate on one spell at a time.
* Whenever you **take damage** while **concentrating** on a spell, you must make a **Constitution saving throw** in order to maintain your concentration. The **DC** equals **10 + damage taken / 5** (rounded down). On a failed save, you **lose concentration**. If you take multiple instances of damage, such as two separate axe attacks, you make a separate saving throw for each instance.
* If you become **incapacitated**, **unconscious** or **dead** while **concentrating** on a spell, you **immediately lose concentration**.
* The **DM might decide** that various phenomena can potentially cause you to lose concentration, either forcing you to make a Constitution saving throw as if you had taken damage, or outright announcing that you have been unable to keep your concentration.

## Combining magical effects

Effects of **different** spells that share time and space **add** together wherever and whenever they overlap. However, mutliple instances of the **same** spell **do not combine**, with **only the most potent** from among those concurrent instances being active at the given moment.

## Spell description

Every spell's description follows the same template, containing the following information.

### Classes

Each spell has a set of classes or subclasses assigned to it, indicating that it's considered to be a part of the available spell list for each of these classes/subclasses.

### Level

Also known as **order**. This number, ranging from 0 through 9, indicates how powerful a spell slot must one expend to cast the spell. Each spellcasting class has a spell slot progression table, which also determines which spells are available for you in the first place - you must have a positive number of spell slots of the given order, for you to know the spells of that order.

The higher the spell's order, the more powerful and/or complex the spell generally is. The order specified in the spell's description is its **base order**. All spells can be also cast using spell slots of order higher than the spell's base order and many of them see their potency increase along with the order of the spell slot level used to cast it.

The **zeroth order** is an exception. Spells of the zeroth order are known as **cantrips**, they aren't fueled by spell slots and are generally acquired differently to the other spells.

**Note:** **Spell level (order)** is not to be confused with **character level**.

### School

Magic schools help categorize spells. The schools themselves don't have particular mechanics attached to them and they have no bearing on the spells' effects, but some class features might refer to them.

### Element

Elements, not unlike schools, are used to categorize spells, and are referred to in class features and certain mechanics, such as scroll writing.

### Casting time

Casting time specifies how long it takes for you to cast the spell. Most spells require **1 action** to cast, but this is not always the case.

Spells with a casting time of **1 bonus action** potentially allow you to cast two spells within one turn. However, you **cannot cast more than one non-cantrip spell** within **the same turn**. Spells with a casting time of **1 reaction** are an exception - they are **not** restricted this way and do not restrict future spells that can be cast within the same turn.

During battle, when you cast a spell with a casting time of **N rounds**, where **N is more than 1 round (6 seconds)**, you must **maintain concentration** and spend your **action** on each turn, focusing on the spell, until the spellcasting process is complete. The spellcasting process is considered completed, firing the spell's effect the instant you use your **N-th action in a row** on the spell, including the first action that initiated the entire spell. If your concentration is broken or you fail to expend an action for the purposes of the spell before you would have completed it, the **spell fails**, but you **don't lose the spell slot**.

### Duration

The **duration** specifies the length of time the spell persists. It can be expressed in various units of time, such as rounds, minutes or hours. However, the actual ending trigger for spells with duration of **1 round**, will quite often vary between individual spells, being specified in the description. Examples include "until the start of your next turn", or "until the end of the target's next turn". By default, if the spell's description doesn't say otherwise, a spell that lasts **1 round** ends at the **start of the caster's next turn**.

The spell's duration might also be **an upper limit** rather than a set value. Such spells usually are **concentration spells**, with their duration specified as "**Concentration, up to (...)**". Such spells end automatically once the duration is up, but are not guaranteed to last that long, given how they also end once the caster's **concentration** is **broken**.

Many spells create effects that are only applied once, such as the *Fireball* spell. The duration of such spells is labeled **instantaneous**.

Some spells can have an **infinite** duration, only ending once a specific condition is met. Such duration is often described as "**until (...)**".

### Range

Whenever you cast a spell that requires you to specify a positive number of targets, the distance between each target and the caster must not be greater than the **range** of the spell being cast. The nature of the spell's target will differ between spells. For example, some spells target creatures or objects, and others might target a point on a surface instead.

Spells with a range of **self** can **directly target** only the caster. However, this doesn't imply that the spell has no potential to damage or otherwise affect other creatures.

### Components

There exist various types of components that the spell might require. Each of the components is indicated in the spell's description by a single letter for quicker reference. If you can't provide one or more components required by the spell, you are unable to cast it.

#### Verbal (V)

The **verbal component** usually represents you chanting mystic words in a foreign language, or otherwise **using your own voice** to direct the magic. You cannot satisfy verbal components if they are unable to speak or if your voice is stifled by an effect such as the *Silence* spell.

#### Somatic (S)

The **somatic component** represents **various gestures**, be it intricate or forceful, being made in the process of casting a spell. You can provide the somatic component if you have **at least one hand** either **completely free** or **holding your spellcasting focus or the material component**. Your hands being restrained usually prevent you from doing so.

#### Focus (F)

The **focus component** is an **item**, on whose energy you draw, or through which you propagate your own energy, in order to produce certain magical effects that would be impossible to conjure otherwise. The type of said item differs depending on your class. You can satisfy the focus component as long as **you have** your **spellcasting focus** on your person. Some classes don't have spellcasting focuses and always satisfy the focus component by default.

#### Material (M)

A **material component** serves a role similar to the focus component, with the exception that the material component depends on the spell rather than the character. You're considered to have satisfied the material component as long as **you have it** on your person. However, some spells might explicitly describe the manner in which the material component must be utilized in order to cast the spell, possibly imposing further requirements on you in terms of satisfying the component.

If the spell states that a material component is **consumed by the spell**, you must provide a separate instance of that component for each individual casting of the spell, given how the component is **destroyed** in the process. **Otherwise**, the material component is **preserved**, making it possible for you to use it multiple times.

### Ritual

Spells that have the **ritual** flag can optionally be cast as **rituals**. In that case the **casting time increases by 10 minutes**, but the casting **doesn't expend a spell slot**, and the caster **doesn't need to have the spell prepared**, although they still need to **know** the spell in order to cast it this way.

### Concentration

Spells with the **concentration** flag are considered **concentration spells**, meaning that the caster must maintain concentration in order to keep sustaining the spell's effects. Certain spells have **optional concentration**, which means that the exact effect of the spell might vary, as per the spell's description, depending on whether the caster has chosen the concentration variant or the regular one.

### Description

The proper **description** of the spell's effect specifies the exact results of the spell's casting and various additional conditions and mechanics that the spell might utilize. This description has priority over all the other information provided in the spell's block. In other words, the description **says what happens**.

## Spell scrolls

If your **language proficiency** allows you to **read** a specific **spell scroll**, and you either **have a positive number of spell slots** or have **Arcana** (for arcane spells) or **Religion** (for divine spells) **proficiency**, you can use the scroll to cast that spell as if you knew it and had it prepared. Spell scrolls have only **one** use and are destroyed once you cast a spell from them.

Casting a spell from a scroll **does not** require you to know the spell, satisfy the spell's class requirements, nor does it force you to expend any spell slots at all. Nearly all scrolls also **already contain** all the **material components** needed for the spell, and the focus component is satisfied by you holding the scroll itself.

The DC of the spell and other individual statistics, such as the spellcasting ability modifier, are taken from the **scroll's author**, not the person casting from the scroll (unless it's explicitly specified otherwise), meaning that the DM should provide you with all such data the moment you successfully identify the scroll.

Wizards can **copy** spells from scrolls to their spellbook in order to learn it permanently, but only as long as it's a Wizard spell of order for which they have Wizard spell slots.
