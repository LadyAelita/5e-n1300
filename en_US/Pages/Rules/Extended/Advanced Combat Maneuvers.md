[gimmick:title](Advanced Combat Maneuvers)

# Advanced Combat Maneuvers

There exist **advanced combat maneuvers** (not to be confused with, for example, battle master maneuvers). The **ACMs** are **available to all** existing creatures **by default**. However, the number of ACMs that a character can use per day is limited by the character's **total level** and their **Strength** and **Dexterity modifiers**.

ACMs are divided into two groups, with respect to attributes: **Strength** and **Dexterity**. The Strength ACMs are then further divided into two categories: **Offensive** and **Defensive**.

## Advanced maneuver points

Advanced maneuver points are a **resource** that can be expended to use ACMs. Each **ACM** costs **a specific number of points**. There exist as many types of points as there are categories of ACMs (**Strength Offensive**, **Strength Defensive** and **Dexterity**), with each individual point **only** being able to fuel **ACMs of the type it represents**.

ACM points **refresh** at the end of a **long rest**.

The number of **Dexterity points** that a character has per day is equal to **half its total level rounded up** or **its Dexterity modifier**, whichever of the two is **lower**.

The number of **Strength points** (the **sum** of the numbers of **Strength Offensive and Strength Defensive** points) that a character has per day **cannot be greater** than **half its total level rounded up**. Moreover, the number of **Strength Offensive points** and the number of **Strength Defensive points** per day, **individually** are **not greater** than the character's **Strength modifier**. In other words: **S<sub>off</sub> + S<sub>def</sub> ≤ ceil(level / 2)** and **S<sub>off</sub> ≤ Str mod** and **S<sub>def</sub> ≤ Str mod**.

The **player selects** which of the Strength points are Offensive and which are Defensive, as long as the numbers satisfy the conditions described above.

### Example

Let there be an Orc Fighter 6/Paladin 3, with **Strength 18**, **Dexterity 12**. His **total level** is **9**. His **Strength modifier** is **+4**, his **Dexterity modifier** is **+1**. **Half his total level**, rounded up, is **5**.

Between **5** (half his total level) and **1** (Dex modifier), **1** is lower, therefore he has **1 Dexterity ACM point** per day.

Individually, his **Strength Offensive** and **Strength Defensive** points are limited by the **Strength modifier**, which is **4**. However, at the same time, the other condition says that the **sum** of the two **cannot be greater** than **5** (half his total level). The player must then select which of the 5 points are Offensive and which are Defensive. As an Orc, he invests as much as possible in offense, in this case **4**, with the **1** remaining point in defense.

## Using advanced maneuvers

### Strength Offensive

Strength Offensive ACMs are **always** used as a **bonus action**. In the process, the character expends the number of Strength Offensive ACM points specified in the maneuver's description. Then, that character's **first Strength-based attack** (first since activating the ACM as a bonus action) made **within the same turn** will be empowered by the activated maneuver. If **that attack hits**, the ACM's effect is **applied to the target** of the attack. If **that attack misses**, the prepared ACM is **wasted**, even if you hit with another attack on the same turn.

### Strength Defensive

The usage of Strength Defensive ACMs **depends** on the specific ACM. The ACM's description will specify what type of action is required to activate the given ACM.

### Dexterity

The usage of Dexterity ACMs **depends** on the specific ACM. The ACM's description will specify what type of action is required to activate the given ACM.

# List of advanced maneuvers

The numbers in brackets specify the number of ACM points that must be spent to use the given maneuver.

## Strength Offensive ACMs

### Sunder Armor (1)

The **target's AC** is **reduced** by **3** until the end of your next turn.

### Slowing Strike (1)

The **target's movement speed** is **reduced** by **20 feet** until the end of your next turn.

### Maiming Attack (1)

Until the end of your next turn, **non-magical physical damage dealt by the target** is **halved**.

If the target's size is **greater** than **Large**, the result of the attack roll must have beaten its Armor Class by at least 2 for each size above Large (2 for Huge, 4 for Gargantuan), otherwise this maneuver's effect doesn't take place.

### Staggering Blow (1)

Until the end of your next turn, the **target has disadvantage** on **all attack rolls**.

If the target's size is **greater** than **Large**, the result of the attack roll must have beaten its Armor Class by at least 2 for each size above Large (2 for Huge, 4 for Gargantuan), otherwise this maneuver's effect doesn't take place.

### Straight in the Head (1)

The target's **Intelligence**, **Wisdom** and **Charisma scores** are **reduced** by **4** until the end of your next turn.

### Curb Initiative (2)

The target is **permanently moved back** in the **initiative order** by **half of the difference between the highest and lowest initiatives**. Ties are broken to the target's disadvantage.

---

## Strength Defensive ACMs

### Taunt (1)

As a **main action** or a **bonus action**, you **protect up to 2 targets**, each **within 5 feet** of you. Whenever anybody tries to attack one of the targets you're protecting, they make a **Wisdom saving throw** against the **DC** of **8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus (if applicable)**.

You add your proficiency bonus **only** if you have a **heavy armor proficiency** gained **from your class**.

You can **only** use this maneuver **if you have already dealt damage** this turn.

### Brace (1)

As a **bonus action**, you gain **resistance to all damage** until the end of your next turn. However, for that duration, your **speed** is **reduced to 0** and cannot be increased in any way, and you have **disadvantage** on **all saving throws**. Moreover, you **cannot** use your **actions**, **reactions** and **bonus actions**, unless you use it to activate this maneuver.

### Rallying Cry (1)

As a **bonus action**, **three creatures** of your choice **within 30 feet** gain a number of **temporary hit points** equal to **half your level rounded up, times your Strength modifier**. The temporary hit points last until the end of your next turn.

### Raise Shield (1)

As a **bonus action**, **you** and **up to 2 creatures within 5 feet** of you gain **+2 AC** from your shield (touch AC also increases) until the end of your next turn or until they are more than 5 feet away from you, whichever happens sooner.

You must be wearing a shield in order to use this maneuver.

### Interpose Self (1)

As a **reaction** to a **creature within 5 feet taking damage** you can **split the damage** meant for the target **equally between the target and yourself** (the division remainder is dealt to you).

### Counter Attack (1)

As a **reaction** to either **you** or a **creature within 5 feet** of you being attacked, you can make a **melee attack** against **the attacker**. If the attacker is outside of your reach, you can **move up to 10 feet** toward them without provoking.

### Adrenaline Rush (2)

As a **bonus action**, you can **prevent going down** due to **your hit points dropping to zero** until the end of your next turn (this does not prevent effects that would specifically instantly kill the character). For that duration, you **remain conscious even at zero** hit points. Taking **additional damage** when **already at zero** hit points **has no effect**.

If you **still have zero hit points** when **this effect ends**, you **go down** and are **battered**.

## Dexterity ACMs

### Call Attention (1)

> It's a trap!
>
> *– Wyran*

As a **reaction**, **before** initiative is rolled, a **creature within 30 feet** of you gets **+d4** to their initiative roll, provided that the target doesn't have a higher Dexterity score than you. You cannot use this ablity if you're **surprised**.

### Conceal (1)

As a **reaction**, **before your first turn**, as long as you **aren't surprised**, you can take the **Hide action** for free. This maneuver can only be used if you're within moving distance of an area where you can potentially hide. If that is the case, you can **move up to your movement speed** (without provoking) to the location where stealth may be achieved.

**After your first turn**, you **can only use this** maneuver **as a bonus action** instead.

### Nimble Rescue (1)

As a **reaction** to a **creature within your moving distance** making a **Dexterity saving throw**, you can attempt to **aid them**.

If **both you and the target** are **already making the same Dexterity saving throw** (for example, you are both in the area of the same fireball), you **must beat** the DC **by at least 2** to be able to use this maneuver. In this case, **beating** the DC **by 2 or more** allows the target to **add +d8** to their saving throw. Beating the DC **by 5 or more** increases the bonus to **+d12**. If you roll a **natural 20** for **your save**, the bonus becomes **+2d8**.

If you **are not** already making the same saving throw as the target, **now you have to make that saving throw**, although you make it with **advantage** and you **have Evasion** for **the purposes of this save**. In this case, **beating** the DC by **less than 2** gives the target **+d8** to their save. Beating the DC by **2 or more** increases the bonus to **+d12**. Beating the DC **by 5 or more** increases the bonus to **+2d8**. If you roll a **natural 20** for **your save**, the bonus becomes **+2d12**.

### Active Recon (1)

As a **reaction**, you can relay pertinent information about nearby enemies to a **creature within 60 feet**. Until the end of the target's next turn, **attacks against the target cannot be made with advantage** and **can only ever crit on a natural 20**. You cannot use this ability if you were ambushed.

### Reposition (1)

As a **reaction** to the **start of another creature's turn**, you can move preemptively up to your movement speed, **borrowing** movement **from your incoming turn**. You are considered to be mid-movement until the current turn ends. **Effects** created during the current turn **target your starting position**. If your **starting position** would be **affected** by an effect, but your **destination is outside** of the effect's **range**, you have **advantage** on **any saving throws against it**, for while you don't manage to completely avoid it, you do so at least partially.

At the start of your next turn after using this maneuver, you must immediately subtract the number of feet you've moved with this maneuver from your remaining movement speed.

### Hot Feet (1)

As a **bonus action**, you **move up to 15 feet**. Moreover, if by the end of this turn you have used all your available movement, you gain **+2 AC** by virtue of dodge (touch AC increases as well) until the end of your next turn.

### Presence of Mind (3)

As a **main action**, a **creature within 60 feet** of you can **use its reaction** to **move up to its movement speed** and **take either one main action or one bonus action**. If the target **attacks** as part of one of these additional actions, it **can only attack half as many times** as it normally would be able to (rounded down, with a minimum of 1 attack). If the target instead **casts a spell** as one of these actions, the spell **cannot** be of **order higher** than ⅓ of the target's highest known spell slot order (rounded up).
