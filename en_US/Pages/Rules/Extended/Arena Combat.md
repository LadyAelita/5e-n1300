[gimmick:title](Arena Combat)

# Arena Combat

In certain situations, groups of combatants face each other in a more orderly setting, rather than chaotic, mindless slaughter. The following extra rules can be applied, partially or as a whole, to make such combat between two teams more honorable and indicative of how able the combatants are when on even ground.

## Terrain

The arena is a **cylinder** with a **diameter** of **300 feet** (radius 150) and **height** of **100 feet**. The entire area is a flat, non-difficult terrain.

Around the center, there are **two deployment areas**, one for each team. Both of these areas are **100 ft x 20 ft** **rectangles** and are separated by a **100 ft x 10 ft rectangular no man's land**. The respective rectangles touch at the **longer**, 100-foot edges.

## Magic items

Each combatant is only allowed to have **5 magic items** in the arena.

## Order of combat

The order of combat is different compared to the default one.

### 0: Entrance

If the team is allowed to have a special entrance and enter, accompanied by a bard playing them to the arena, they can receive dice of bardic inspiration from the bard to use throughout the match.

### 1: Ritual phase

The **only** action that can be taken by either team in this phase is the application of **buffs**.

A **buff** is any **spell or special ability**, that:

* has a **duration** of **at least one round**,
* does not target enemies,
* has a **casting time up to 10 minutes**.

During the ritual phase, each team might administer **up to 3 buffs**, provided by any combination of its combatants. Buffs applied in this phase are further restricted:

* the buff cannot leave an effect on the ground, unless the effect is centered around the caster and follows them around, or is a summon,
* the buff cannot provide invisibility.

Buffs applied in the ritual phase retain their full duration until the first round of combat. The timer for each buff begins when the character who applied it takes their first combat turn (the buff still provides full benefits even before the timer starts). However, buffs can also end before the timer starts, as a result of losing concentration or dispel magic, for example.

### 2: Initiative phase

Each team chooses a character to lead them in the initiative contest. Both leaders (and **only** them) **roll initiative**, determining which **team** goes first. Unless a combatant dies, the two teams will always alternate when taking turns (as in, the same team does not take two turns in a row).

Both teams then decide their internal order, in which their own combatants will take turns, from among the set of turns available to the team. However, the leader must be either **first** or **second** within their own team.

Summons go at the same time as their summoner.

### 3: Deployment phase

Each team **selects the position** of its combatants in the **reverse combat initiative order** - the character that goes last in combat is deployed first.

A team can deploy their characters only within their own **deployment area**. Moreover, if a character has an area effect attached to them, they must be deployed in such a way, that the effect does not intersect with the enemy deployment area.

### 4: Tension phase

All the combatants now take two rounds with accordance to the estabilished combat initiative. However, in this phase the combat hasn't started yet, and their actions are still limited.

On their turn, each character can **move within their deployment area**. If they have area effects attached to them, they must move in such a way, that the effect does not intersect with the enemy deployment area.

Moreover, on their turn, **each combatant** can apply **one buff** (one throughout the **entire** tension phase), with the following restrictions:

* the buff cannot have a cast time longer than 1 turn,
* if the buff creates effects on the ground, it must be placed in such a way, that the effect does not intersect with the enemy deployment area.

**Note:** The buff restrictions specific to the ritual phase **do not hold** in the tension phrase. In other words, you can cast Invisibility and create effects on the ground, be it helpful or damaging. However, the buff still has to satisfy the definition of a buff.

### 5: Combat

Once each character has taken two turns in the tension phase, combat begins as per usual.

## Forfeit

Throughout the combat, the captain of the team can throw the towel, signaling a **forfeit**. If the captain is incapacitated, any other member of the team can do that.

Forfeiting can be done as **an action** or **a reaction**. The reaction is triggered by any action of another combatant, for example, an attack or a spell being cast. You can forfeit **before** the triggering action goes off, in order to prevent it from happening by stopping the match.
