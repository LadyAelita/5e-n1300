[gimmick:title](Conditions)
# Conditions

## Blinded

• A blinded creature **can’t see** and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls **always** have disadvantage.
• **NEW:** The disadvantage imposed on a blinded creature's attacks always has the **absolute highest priority** and **never** cancels out with advantage.

## Charmed

• A charmed creature **can't attack** the charmer or **target** the charmer with **harmful** abilities or magical effects.
• The charmer has **advantage** on any **ability check** to interact **socially** with the creature.

## Dazed

• The creature must move at **half speed**, otherwise it must make a Dexterity saving throw against DC 12, falling prone on a failure.
• The creature cannot take the **dash** action.
• The creature has **disadvantage** on **attack** rolls, **Acrobatics** checks and **Strength** and **Dexterity** saving throws.
• The creature **always** has **disadvantage** on Concentration checks. This disadvantage never cancels out with advantage.
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

## Deafened

• A deafened creature **can’t hear** and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.
• **NEW:** A deafened creature has **disadvantage** on **Dexterity** saving throws.

## Death

### 1: Unconscious

• An unconscious creature is **incapacitated** (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.
• The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls **prone**.
• The creature regains consciousness after 1d8 hours, when it's firmly woken up, or when it regains a positive amount of HP.
• Upon regaining consciousness, the creature still remains **incapacitated** and is now **dazed**. On its first turn since regaining consciousness, the creature makes a **DC 10** **Constitution saving throw** to try and compose itself. On a success, it's no longer incapacitated and dazed. On a failure, it remains incapacitated and dazed until the start of its next turn.
• During battle, an unconscious creature can roll a d20 on its turn. On a 20, it regains 1 hit point, becoming conscious again. It then still must compose itself as per usual, making the Constitution saving throw immediately, on the same turn as it managed to stabilize itself.
• If the creature takes damage, it becomes **dying**.

### 2: Dying

• The creature is also **unconscious**.
• The creature makes a **death saving throw** immediately when entering this state and then once **at the start of its every turn**. A successful makeshift first aid attempt (no healer's kit, a Survival or Medicine check against DC 10) gives the creature advantage on those saves.
• The creature makes a **death saving throw** every time it takes damage.
• The creature stops dying and becomes **unconscious** instead after a successful first aid attempt with a healer's kit (a Survival or Medicine check with advantage against DC 10).
• The creature stops dying and becomes **unconscious** instead when it regains a positive amount of HP.

### 3: Dead

• A dead creature has been **killed** and is **not alive** as a result of either **death** or **demise**. Its life has been **terminated** and therefore has come to an **end**, rendering it a **casualty**. Because of that, it cannot take any action.
• The creature stops being dead when it's resurrected with magic or other special effects.

## Fear

The frightened condition has been reworked and split into levels, not unlike the **exhaustion** mechanic. Just like exhaustion levels, **fear levels stack** on top of each other. Contary to exhaustion, though, fear generally lasts a set duration and can be removed through a successful save against the effect causing it.

When a creature **breaks** an ongoing fear effect (rather than having avoided it totally by beating the save on the first try), **all** of its fear levels are removed.

When a creature **blocks** an incoming fear effect by successfully saving against it on the first try, its fear level **stays the same**. If the success was **critical**, though, **all** of its fear levels are removed.

Whenever a creature that has fear levels is subject to yet another fear-inducing effect, the fear level is increased by **1**, or by the smallest number big enough to reach the specific condition mentioned in the description of said effect, whichever is **higher**. For instance: an effect causing **panic** (levels 4-5) applied to a **fearful** (level 2) creature, gives it additional **2 fear levels**. However, the same **panic**-inducing effect applied to a creature that's **already panicked**, would instead give it **1 additional fear level**.

### 1: Shaken

• A shaken creature has -1 to attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks.

### 2: Fearful

• Whenever a fearful creature makes an attack against the source of its fear, it has **disadvantage** in place of the -1 penalty.

### 3: Frightened

*This is the same as the* ***frightened*** *condition from vanilla D&D 5e.*
• A frightened creature has **disadvantage** on ability checks and attack rolls (against anybody) while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
• The creature **can’t** willingly **move closer** to the source of its fear.

### 4-5: Panicked

• A panicked creature **must** try to **run as far away** as possible from the source of its fear, by any means necessary. It cannot take actions other than the **dash** action, or actions that can allow it to get away even quicker.
• The creature **cannot** take **reactions**.
• If there is no possiblity to run any further, the creature is allowed to take **attack** and **dodge** actions.

### 6: Terrified

• A terrified creature is **helpless**.

## Grappled

• A grappled creature’s **speed becomes 0**, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
• The condition ends if the grappler is **incapacitated** or if an effect **removes** the **grappled** creature **from the reach** of the grappler or grappling effect (such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell).
• **NEW:** A grappled creature cannot take the **Disengage** action.

## Helpless

• A helpless creature is **incapacitated** - it can't take actions or reactions.
• The creature cannot move or speak.
• The creature automatically fails **Strength** and **Dexterity** saving throws.

• The creature becomes a valid target for a Coup de Grâce.

## Incapacitated

• An incapacitated creature can’t take **actions** or **reactions**.

## Invisible

• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any n oise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.
• **NEW:** A creature that's invisible from another creature's point of view renders all their interactions treated as if the observer was **blinded**.

## Paralyzed

• A paralyzed creature is **incapacitated** (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.
• The creature is unable to move at all. As a result, their field of view is restricted and cannot be changed by turning around.

## Petrified

• A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is w earing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its **weight** increases by a **factor of ten**, and it ceases aging.

• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
• The creature automatically fails **Strength** and **Dexterity** saving throws.
• The creature has **resistance** to all damage.
• The creature is **immune** to **poison** and **disease**, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

## Poisoned

• A poisoned creature has **disadvantage** on **attack** rolls and **ability** checks.

## Prone

• A prone creature’s **only movement** option is to **crawl**, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
• The creature has **disadvantage** on **attack** rolls.
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker ~~is within 5 feet of the creature~~ is using either no weapon or a melee weapon. Otherwise (ranged attacks), the attack roll has disadvantage.
• **NEW:** The only main actions that the creature can take are: **attack**, **cast a spell**, **activate item** and **disengage**.
• **NEW:** The creature can get up by spending ~~half of its speed~~ its entire movement. If the creature's speed is **reduced to 0**, it **cannot** get up. Such an attempt to get up **provokes** opportunity attacks. If any of such opportunity attacks beats the creature's AC by more than 5, the creature is knocked right back down.
• **NEW:** The creature can take the **disengage** action to get up instantly without provoking opportunity attacks.
• **NEW:** The creature has **disadvantage** on **Dexterity** saving throws.

## Restrained

• The creature can't take **reactions**.
• The creature can take an action **or** a bonus action, but not both, within one turn.
• The creature can't make more than one attack in total within one turn.

## Stunned

• A stunned creature is **incapacitated** (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.
• The creature automatically fails **Strength** and **Dexterity** saving throws.
