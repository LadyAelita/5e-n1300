## Features

* **Ability Score Increase:** +2 Dexterity.
* **Age:** Elves reach physical maturity at a much later age than humans - typically at around 40 years old. They completely cease aging once they reach the age of 100, which is equivalent to a human being 35 years old.
* **Alignment:** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly towards the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and are good more often than not.

* **Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
* **Trance:** Elves do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a human would from 8 hours of sleep.
* **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write **Common** and **Aelven**.
