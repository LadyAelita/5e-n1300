# Half-Elf

## Features

* **Ability Score Increase:** +2 Charisma, +1 to two other ability scores of your choice.
* **Age:** Half-elves age at a slightly slower rate than humans, reaching adulthood at around the age of 23. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 250 years.
* **Alignment:**  Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They both value personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others' demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable. They are good and evil in equal numbers, a trait they share with their human parents.
* **Size:** Half-elves are more or less the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.
* **Speed:** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
* **Darkvision:** Thanks to your elven heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
* **Fey Ancestry:** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
* **Languages:** You know **Common** and **Aelven**, being **Fluent** in one and **Passable** with the other, depending on your choice. Moreover, you're **Passable** with one additional language of your choice. The extra language cannot be the same as a language you're using for the verbal component of your spells.
* **Mixed Ancestry:** Either gain **proficiency** in **a skill** of your choice, or gain any feature of your choice from one of the Elf subraces.
