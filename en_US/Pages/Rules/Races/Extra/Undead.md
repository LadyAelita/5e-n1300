[gimmick:title](Undead)

# Undead

This is a **template race**. When creating an **undead** character, you first create a character of any other, living race, and only then apply the changes described in the template below.

## Features

* **Age:** Undead do not age.
* **Alignment:** Most undead turn either toward moral neutrality or straight up evil. They are unfettered by nature, as they do not bear most limitations that come with being alive, and are also hardly able to feel even a modecom of pleasure.
* **Darkvision:** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. If you already have a different feature that influenced your sight, you lose that feature.
* **Profane Nature:** You are vulnerable to radiant damage.
* **Relentless Endurance:** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest. If your base race already gives you such a feature, you can use it twice between long rests.
* **Undead Nature:** You don't require air, food, drink or sleep. You are immune to poison, disease and exhaustion. Whenever you take necrotic damage, instead of taking the damage, you are healed by the same amount.
* **Trance:** Undead do not sleep. Instead they meditate deeply, remaining semi-conscious, for 4 hours a day. The Common word for this meditation is "trance". While meditating, you dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive after years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit a living human would from 8 hours of sleep.
