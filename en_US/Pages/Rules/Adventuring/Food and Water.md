[gimmick:title](Food and Water)

# Food and Water

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water **can't be removed** until the character eats and drinks the **full required** amount.

## Food

A character needs **one pound of food per day** and can make saturation last longer by **subsisting on half rations**. Eating **half a pound of food in a day** counts as **half a day without food**.

A character can go **without food** for a number of **days** equal to **3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 day)**. At **the end of each day beyond** that limit, a character automatically **suffers one level of exhaustion**.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

## Water

A character needs **one gallon (almost 4 liters) of water per day**, or **two gallons (about 7.5 liters)** per day if the **weather is hot**. A character who drinks only **half that much** water must succeed on a **DC 15 Constitution** saving throw or **suffer one level of exhaustion** at the **end of the day**. 

A character with access to **even less** water **automatically** suffers **one level of exhaustion** at the end of the day. If the character **already has one or more** levels of exhaustion, they take **two levels** in either case.

## Foraging

Characters can **gather food and water** as the party travels at a **normal** or **slow** pace. A foraging character makes a **Survival** check whenever the GM calls for it, with the DC determined by the GM according to the abundance of food and water in the region. If multiple characters forage, **each** character makes a **separate** check.

A foraging character finds **nothing** on a failed check. On a successful check, roll **1d6 + Wisdom modifier** to determine how much food (in pounds) the character finds, then repeat the roll for water (in gallons).
