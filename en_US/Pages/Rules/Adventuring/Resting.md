# Resting

## Short rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, **at least 1 hour long**, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice **at the end of a short rest**, up to the character's current number of remaining Hit Dice. Initially, a character has a number of Hit Dice equal to their total character level. For each Hit Die spent during a short rest, the player rolls the die and **adds** the character's **Constitution modifier** to it. The character regains hit points equal to the result. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die **after each roll** - there is no need to select the number of Hit Dice expended in advance and stick to it.

If an effect or ability is described as available a given number of times "**between rests**", that means its cooldown refreshes at the end of a **short rest**.

## Long rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, **at least 8 hours long**, during which a character **sleeps** or performs **light activity**: reading, talking, eating, or standing watch for **no more than 2 hours**. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity (at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity) the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

**At the end** of a long rest, a character regains **all lost hit points**. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to **half of the character's total number** of them (**minimum of one** die). For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

Moreover, finishing a long rest **reduces** your **exhaustion** level (if any) by **1**, provided that you have ingested some food and drink.

A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a **24-hour period**, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.

If an effect or ability is described as available a given number of times "**per day**", that means its cooldown refreshes at the end of a **long rest**.
