[gimmick:title](Travel)

# Travel

Every creature has a **speed**, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round (**1 square tile** has a side of **5 feet**). This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation. It's written on your character sheet.

However, while traveling long distances, characters don't move with as much urgency as during a combat, and the travel might see the party stop to take a break once in a while. As a result, the net speed is smaller than could be expected based on the characters' walking speed.

## Travel pace

A group of characters might opt to travel faster or slower than normally. Each pace comes with different benefits or penalties, as shown in the table below.

| Pace       | Distance (1 hour)        | Distance (1 day) | Hours until exhaustion        | Description                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Dash**   | 6 miles                  | 60 miles         | Constitution modifier         | -10 penalty to passive Perception scores |
| **Combat** | 3 miles                  | 30 miles         | 2 times Constitution modifier | -5 penalty to passive Perception scores  |
| **Fast**   | 1.5 mile                 | 15 miles         | 10                            | -5 penalty to passive Perception scores  |
| **Normal** | 1 mile (approx. 5000 ft) | 10 miles         | 10                            | -                                        |
| **Slow**   | 0.5 mile                 | 5 miles          | 10                            | Able to use stealth                      |

## Difficult terrain

Difficult terrain hinders long distance travel in a similar manner to in-combat movement. When traveling through difficult terrain, the party moves at **half speed**.

## Forced march

The rules assume that **a day** of travel lasts **10 hours**, which is how long the characters can travel without getting exhausted.

A character can move at their regular, combat speed even for long distance travel purposes, but they can only do so for a **number of hours** equal to **twice their Constitution modifier**. 

Similarly, they can keep taking the **dash** action on each "turn" of the travel, effectively moving at **twice** their combat speed, but in that case, they can only keep doing so for a **number of hours** equal to **their Constitution modifier**, period. This value can never go higher than **10 hours**.

Creatures that **do not suffer from exhaustion** (such as most undead) **ignore** that limitation and can travel for as many hours as they want.

Other creatures may push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion. Once a character reaches their limit of hours that can be traveled without getting exhausted, travelling farther will count as a **forced march**.

At the **end of each additional hour** of travel **beyond the limit**, the character must make a **Constitution saving throw** against the DC of **10 + the number of hours traveled beyond the limit**. On a failed saving throw, the character suffers **1 level of exhaustion**. If the character has been **dashing** for the last hour, the throw is made with a **disadvantage** and a failure adds **2 levels of exhaustion** instead of one.

**Note:** Having **2 or more** levels of exhaustion **halves the speed**. Having **5** renders the character **unable to move at all**.

## Mounts and vehicles

Characters can ride **mounts** instead of going by foot. This only gives an advantage when going at the **combat** or **dash** pace, where the mount's speed is used instead of the characters' speed. In such case, it is the **mounts** that are subject to the respective **hours until exhaustion** limit, using **their** Constitution modifier, while the characters are treated as if they were travelling at merely a **fast** pace and are only limited by the regular 10 hours.

**Hint:** A good mount will likely have a combat speed **twice as fast** as your characters and a **Constitution modifier** of **+1**, while **undead** mounts don't get exhausted at all.

An animal mount can also pull a carriage, chart, chariot, sled or a wagon. It can move weight up to **5 times** its **base pulling Capacity** (the base pulling Capacity is **30 times Strength** for medium-sized creatures), including the weight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they add their results together.

Traveling with a **mechanized vehicle** is different in many aspects. Such a vehicle cannot get conventionally exhausted, but it might run out of **fuel** or **energy**. It might also not be suited to be driven in the wilderness, and a character needs to be skilled in the usage of the specific vehicle.
