[gimmick:title](Exhaustion)

# Exhaustion

Some special abilities, spells, or environmental hazards, such as extreme temperatures, starvation or thirst, lead to **exhaustion**. 

Exhaustion is a mechanic measured in six **levels**. Gaining a number of exhaustion levels increases the current exhaustion level by that number.

Penalties imposed by subsequent exhaustion levels **stack** on top of each other. For example, at 3 exhaustion levels, you're suffering from the effects of exhaustion level 1, level 2 **and** level 3 - you have disadvantage on Ability Checks, your movement speed is halved and you have disadvantage on Attacks and Saving Throws.
