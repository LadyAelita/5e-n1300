# Environment

## Falling

At the end of a fall, a creature takes **1d6 fall damage** for every **10 feet** it fell, to a **maximum of 20d6**. The creature lands prone, unless it somehow avoids taking damage from the fall.

**Fall** damage is a separate damage type that is **not reduced** by effects that reduce all damage taken, unless the effect's description **explicitly** says it applies to fall damage.

The following table describes the downward velocity **V<sub>i</sub>**, with which the creature hit the ground, based on the fall damage roll, which corresponds to specific fall distances.

| Fall distance | Roll | V<sub>i</sub> |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| 0-9 ft        | 0    | 0-25 ft/s     |
| 10-19 ft      | 1d6  | 30 ft/s       |
| 20-29 ft      | 2d6  | 40 ft/s       |
| 30-39 ft      | 3d6  | 45 ft/s       |
| 40-49 ft      | 4d6  | 50 ft/s       |
| 50-59 ft      | 5d6  | 60 ft/s       |
| 60-69 ft      | 6d6  | 65 ft/s       |
| 70-79 ft      | 7d6  | 70 ft/s       |
| 80-89 ft      | 8d6  | 75 ft/s       |
| 90-99 ft      | 9d6  | 77 ft/s       |
| 100-109 ft    | 10d6 | 82 ft/s       |
| 110-119 ft    | 11d6 | 85 ft/s       |
| 120-129 ft    | 12d6 | 89 ft/s       |
| 130-139 ft    | 13d6 | 93 ft/s       |
| 140-149 ft    | 14d6 | 96 ft/s       |
| 150-159 ft    | 15d6 | 100 ft/s      |
| 160-169 ft    | 16d6 | 102 ft/s      |
| 170-179 ft    | 17d6 | 105 ft/s      |
| 180-189 ft    | 18d6 | 109 ft/s      |
| 190-199 ft    | 19d6 | 110 ft/s      |
| 200+ ft       | 20d6 | 113 ft/s      |

## Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of **minutes** equal to **1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds)**.

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of **rounds** equal to its **Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round)**. At the start of its next turn, it drops to **0 hit points** and is **dying**, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.

## Vision and light

A given area might be **lightly** or **heavily** **obscured**. 

In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area, such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage, blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the **blinded** condition when trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: **bright light**, **dim light**, and **darkness**.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a **lightly obscured** area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

**Darkness** creates a **heavily obscured** area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.

### Blindsight

A creature with **blindsight** can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures **without eyes** and creatures with **echolocation** or **heightened senses** have this sense.

### Darkvision

Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have **darkvision**. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness **as if the darkness were dim light**, so areas of darkness are only **lightly obscured** as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature **can't discern color** in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Truesight

A creature with **truesight** can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic.

Furthermore, the creature can see into the **Ethereal Plane**.

## Weather conditions

### Extreme cold

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius), a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution** saving throw at the **end of each hour** or gain **one level of exhaustion**. Creatures with **resistance** or **immunity** to **cold** damage **automatically succeed** on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.

### Extreme heat

When the temperature is at or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), a creature exposed to the heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a **Constitution** saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. The DC is **5** for the **first hour** and **increases by 1** for **each additional hour**. Creatures wearing **medium** or **heavy armor**, or who are clad in **heavy clothing**, have **disadvantage** on the saving throw. Creatures with **resistance** or **immunity** to **fire** damage **automatically succeed** on the saving throw, as do creatures naturally adapted to hot climates.

### Strong wind

A strong wind imposes **disadvantage** on **ranged weapon attacks** and Perception checks that rely on **hearing**. A strong wind also extinguishes open flames, disperses fog, and makes flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall. A strong wind in a desert can create a **sandstorm** that imposes disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on **sight**.

### Heavy precipitation

Everything within an area of **heavy rain** or **heavy snowfall** is **lightly obscured**, and creatures in the area have **disadvantage** on Perception checks that rely on **sight**. Heavy **rain** also extinguishes open flames and imposes **disadvantage** on Perception checks that rely on **hearing**.

## Wilderness hazards

### Frigid water

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a **number of minutes** equal to its **Constitution score** before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a **DC 10 Constitution** saving throw or gain **one level of exhaustion**. 

Creatures with **resistance** or **immunity** to **cold** damage **automatically succeed** on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.

### Quicksand

A quicksand pit covers the ground in roughly a **10-foot square** area and is usually **10 feet deep**. When a creature enters the area, it sinks **1d4 + 1 feet** into the quicksand and becomes **restrained**. At the **start of each** of the creature's **turns**, it sinks **another 1d4 feet**. 

As long as the creature **isn't completely submerged** in quicksand, it can **escape** by using its **action** and succeeding on a **Strength** check. The DC is **10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk** into the quicksand. A creature that is **completely submerged** in quicksand **can't breathe** (see the **suffocation** rules).

A creature can **pull** another creature **within its reach** out of a quicksand pit by using its **action** and succeeding on a **Strength** check. The DC is **5 plus the number of feet the target creature has sunk** into the quicksand.

### Razorvine

Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. 

A **10-foot-high**, **10-foot-wide**, **5-foot-thick** wall or hedge of razorvine has **AC 11**, **25 hit points**, and **immunity** to **bludgeoning**, **piercing**, and **psychic** damage. 

When a creature comes into direct contact with razorvine **for the first time on a turn**, the creature must succeed on a **DC 10 Dexterity** saving throw or take **5** (**1d10**) **slashing damage** from the razorvine's bladelike thorns.

### Slippery ice

Slippery ice is **difficult terrain**. When a creature moves onto slippery ice **for the first time on a turn**, it must succeed on a **DC 10 Acrobatics** check or fall **prone**.

### Thin ice

Thin ice has a weight tolerance of **3d10 x 10 pounds per 10-foot-square area**. Whenever the total weight on an area of thin ice exceeds its tolerance, the ice in that area **breaks**. All creatures on broken ice **fall through**.
