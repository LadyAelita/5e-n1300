### Description

You transform a portion of your blood into a harmful, venomous substance. As you cast this spell, you must spend a number of hit points. You gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the amount spent.

For as long as these temporary hit points last, whenever a creature hits you with a melee attack, they take 3d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the start of their next turn. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 4th.
