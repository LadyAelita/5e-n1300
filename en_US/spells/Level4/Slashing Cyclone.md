### Description

You swing blades of wind around you. Each creature within range makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 8d8 slashing damage and get moved 5 feet (you choose the direction). On a successful save, the creatures only take half the damage and don't have to move.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and the range increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
