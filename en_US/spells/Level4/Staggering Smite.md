### Description

The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your weapon pierces both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra 4d6 psychic damage to the target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by 1d6 for each slot level above the 4th.
