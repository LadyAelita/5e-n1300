### Description

A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned, the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its reaction to stand up.

The target also regains 10 orders of spell slots. None of the regained spell slots can be of 6th or higher order. Advanced combat maneuver slots each count as 1 order of a spell slot for the purpose of this spell.

This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
