### Description

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range becomes frightened and takes 8d12 psychic damage. The illusion calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 8d12 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
