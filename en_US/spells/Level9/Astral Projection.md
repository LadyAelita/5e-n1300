### Description

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your souls simultaneously into the Terrestrial Plane and the Ethereal Plane, each creating an astral body. The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation, it doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.

Your astral body is an incorporeal image of your material form. It doesn't posses Strength or Constitution scores, using your spellcasting ability instead of either of those when necessary. It doesn't inherit carry over any resistances of your physical form and has a base armor class of 16. The hit die of your astral body is d20. 

Your projection travels freely through the projection of the Terrestrial Plane in the Ethereal Plane, moving three times as fast. It also gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed, but cannot fly higher than 60 feet above a surface. It cannot interact with the Terrestrial Plane in any way except through casting spells.

Your projection can only be damaged from the Terrestrial Plane through magical or supernatural means. However, it doesn't have such an immunity when attacked from the Ethereal Plane. Whenever your projection loses hit points, it also loses a portion of its arcane energy and is forced to expend a total of arcane spell slot levels equal to the damage divided by 10.

The constant connection to the Ethereal Plane allows your arcane energy to return quicker to you, restoring your arcane spell slots. Your arcane spell slots are being restored one at a time, starting with the least recently expended one. Each spell slot is restored with a delay equal to its level times (1 minute + 1 minute for every 50 miles of distance between your material and astral bodies, measured on the Terrestrial Plane).

If your projection dies on the Terrestrial plane, the spell ends for you, keeping your material body intact, but rendering you shocked, decreasing your Wisdom score down to 3. You then keep regaining d4 of your Wisdom at the end of every hour.

If you move your projection to the location of your material body, you can end the spell in a stable way. However, doing so results in all of your companions (if any) being forced back to their bodies as well. Unless their projections were at the respective locations of their material bodies as well, they will still suffer the shock described above.

If the connection between your astral and material bodies is severed, your physical body dies and you are stuck in the astral form. In this case, your spell slots no longer regenerate and you have to beat a DC 20 Charisma saving throw at the end of every hour, or lose 1 Charisma. Once you get to 0 Charisma, your soul gets permanently annihilated. At the end of every month you survive in such circumstances, you must beat a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or lose d4 Wisdom. Once you get to 0 Wisdom, you turn into a vengeful wraith.

The connection can be broken by cutting the invisible string which serves as a tether between your astral and material bodies. It can only be done by those with the rare ability to perceive the streams of energy in the air, and only with a pure star steel blade. Another way your connection can be broken is if your astral body is killed with such a weapon by a creature that's on the Ethereal Plane.

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, as there is no way for you to end the spell from within your material body.
