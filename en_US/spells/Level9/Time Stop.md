### Description

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4+1 turns in a row, during which you can use actions and move as normal.

Any effects that you create during this period that affect a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you are suspended and delayed. Once the spell ends, the suspended effects all take place simultaneously.

The spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.
