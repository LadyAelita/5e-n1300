### Description

You animate a sword for the duration and move it up to 30 feet. As you cast this spell, you make three melee spell attacks against a target within the reach of the animated sword. On each hit, the target takes 2d12 slashing damage.

On each of your turns, while the spell lasts, you can use your bonus action to move the sword up to 30 feet and make two attacks with it.

If you are within your animated sword's reach, you can use your reaction to have this sword parry an incoming melee attack, giving you +1 AC until the start of your next turn.

Once the distance between you and an animated sword becomes greater than 60 feet, the spell instantly ends on the sword as it drops to the ground.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can animate an additional sword for every spell slot level above 7th. Whenever you move your swords as a bonus action, you can individually move every sword at same time. However, each of the animated swords except for the first one can only make one attack per turn. If you are within reach of multiple animated swords at the same time, the reaction gives you an extra +1 AC for each additional sword.
