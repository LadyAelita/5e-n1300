### Description

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains 3d12 + 12 hit points instantly. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 3d12 + 12 hit points at the start of each of its turns. 

The target's severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored once the spell's duration ends. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump.

If the target is undead, it instead begins to decay rapidly. It makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d12 + 12 true damage instantly. Then, for the duration of the spell, it takes 3d12 + 12 true damage at the start of each of their turn. On a successful save, both the initial and reocurring damage is halved.

This spell has no effect on constructs.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the amount of both initial and reocurring healing (or damage, for undead targets) increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 7th.
