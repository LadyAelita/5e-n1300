### Description

You step into the Astral Projection region of the Ethereal Plane, which is the image of the Terrestrial Plane. You remain there for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can move thrice as fast, given how the region is a scaled down image of the actual plane. You can see and hear the source plane, but everything there looks and sounds foggy, blurry and unclear, with the sounds being only heard as quieter, low-to-mid tones heavy background noise. Moreover, you cannot perceive anything more than 60 feet away from you.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

You cannot move through solid objects, that exist on the Terrestrial Plane, and you also cannot interact with them by applying any force, physical or magical.

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the Terrestrial Plane, in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as another creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on any other plane than the Terrestrial Plane.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.
