### Description

You speak a word of power that causes waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. The target is unaffected if it is immune to being charmed.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

The pain lasts until the end of the target's next turn, unless the target has 100 or fewer hit points, in which case the target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, only ending the pain on a successful save.
