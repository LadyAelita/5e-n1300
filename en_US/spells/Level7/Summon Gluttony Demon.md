### Description

You summon a gluttony demon that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The demon's attitude depends on the value of the food used as a material component for this spell. Roll initiative for the demon, which has its own turns. At the start of the demon's turn, the DM makes a secret Charisma check on your behalf, with a bonus equal to the food's value divided by 20. The check DC starts at 10 and increases by 2 each round. You can issue orders to the demon and have it obey you as long as you succeed on the Charisma check.

If the check fails, the spell no longer requires concentration and the demon is no longer under your control. The demon then focuses on devouring any corpses it can see. If there are no such meals at hand, it attacks the nearest creatures and eats anything it kills. If its hit points are reduced to below half its hit point maximum, it returns to the Abyss.

As part of casting the spell, you can form a circle on the ground with either your blood, blood of an intelligent humanoid killed within the last 24 hours, or garnet dust. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it can't target anyone within it. The circle is consumed when the spell ends.
