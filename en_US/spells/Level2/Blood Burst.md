### Description

You point your finger, and the creature that has taken slashing or piercing damage momentarily sees their freshly acquired wounds burst wide open. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on creatures that don't have blood.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.
