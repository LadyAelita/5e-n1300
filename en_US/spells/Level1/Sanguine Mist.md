### Description

You use your own blood to procure an eldritch crimson mist that shoots out of your mouth. You take 1 true damage. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is blinded until the end of its next turn on a failed save, or takes half as much damage and isn't blinded on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
