### Description

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear or see, but you must be touching the surface of which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text. You do not learn the language, nor are you considered to be proficient in it in any way.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language. Similarly, it doesn't make you able to read scrolls written in the given language.
