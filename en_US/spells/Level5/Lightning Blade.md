### Description

You create an unstable, living lightning ball in your hand, which sparks chaotically, making a loud noise. It lasts until the end of your next turn, until your concentration ends, or until you make an attack with it, whichever of the three happens sooner.

The lightning counts as a melee weapon you're proficient with. It has a reach of 5 feet. You can use your action to make one attack with it, making a melee spell touch attack against a target. A regular attack with the lightning deals 2d4 slashing and 3d12 lightning damage to the target.

If you make a charging attack with the lightning, the attack instead ideals 5d12 lightning damage and for every 10 feet you've covered in a straight line with the charge movement, an additional 1d4 slashing damage. However, for every 10 feet of charging movement above 120 feet, you take an additional 1d4 true damage as well.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the lightning damage of the charging attack increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 5th, and the lightning damage of the standing attack increases by 1d12 every two spell slot levels above 5th. Moreover, at 7th and 8th levels, the slashing and backlash damage die increases from d4 to d6, and at 9th level, the die increases to d8.
