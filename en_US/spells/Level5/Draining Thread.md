### Description

You open a wound on your hand, shooting out a charging thread of blood at a creature within range. As you cast the spell, you must spend a number of hit points. The target must then succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, taking 7d6 + the number of hit points spent as necrotic damage on a failure, or half that damage on a success. If this damage brings the target to 0 hit points, the hit point cost is refunded as blood drains through the thread back into your body.

**At Higher Levels:** The damage increases by 2d6 for every spell slot level above 5th.
