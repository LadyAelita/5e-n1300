### Description

This brutal spell causes the targeted creature to dehydrate horribly as the moisture in its body is forcibly extracted through its eyes, nostrils, mouth, and pores. The target makes a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d8 + 20 force damage and on a failed save, or half that damage on a successful one. Until the spell ends, the target is grappled by your telekinetic force. You can use your action on each of your turns to automatically deal 7d8 + 20 force damage to the target if it had failed the Constitution saving throw, or half that damage if it had succeeded. The target can use their action on each of their turns to try and escape the grapple, making an Athletics or Acrobatics check against your spell save DC. If the grapple is broken, the spell ends.

If the damage from this spell kills the target, you can optionally keep concentrating and form a Water Elemental from the extracted liquid. The elemental appears in the target's space. It doesn't take any actions on its own. You have complete control over it and it moves on your initiative.

This spell has no effect on creatures that don't have liquids in their body that are crucial to their health.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, both the initial and reocurring damage increases by 1d8 and the target has disadvantage on their attempts to escape the grapple.
