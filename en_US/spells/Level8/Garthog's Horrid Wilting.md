### Description

You draw the moisture from every creature in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. Constructs and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.
