### Description

A protective barrier surrounds the target until the end of the target's next turn. The barrier has 10 layers, each layer increasing the target's AC by 1. This bonus stacks with other shield and cover based AC bonuses, while still affecting the touch AC. As long as the barrier exists, the damage taken by the target is halved (this reduction stacks with other resistances), unless it's explicitly stated to be irresistible.

While any layers persist, all attacks that hit the target are entirely redirected into the barrier, damaging it for the damage of the attack divided by 10 (rounded down). That damage cannot be reduced in any other way. The barrier then loses one of its layers for each point of damage it takes. This is the only way to deal damage to the barrier.

When the last remaining layer is destroyed, the barrier explodes in a forceful and disorienting manner, imposing disadvantage on all attack rolls made against the previously shielded target until the end of the current combatant's turn. The target does not take any excess damage from the attack that successfully penetrated the barrier.

If the barrier expires without having been destroyed, the target is granted a number of temporary hit points equal to 5 times the number of layers the barrier had at the moment of expiration. Those temporary hit points last until the target's next long rest.
