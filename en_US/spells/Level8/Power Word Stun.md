### Description

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. The target is stunned until the end of its next turn. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it remains stunned beyond that point and must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
