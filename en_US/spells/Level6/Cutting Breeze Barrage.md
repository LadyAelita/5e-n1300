### Description

You throw over a dozen of small darts of barely visible force that travel at the speed of sound, cutting the flesh of creatures in a line of 60 feet long and 15 feet wide. The first two creatures on the spell's path take 15d4 slashing damage. All creatures beyond take 5d4 slashing damage instead.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the initial target damage increases by  2d4, and the secondary target damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 6th.
